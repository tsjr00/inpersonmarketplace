# South Plains (Lubbock Area → North Panhandle)  
## High-Signal Candidates for a Local Pre‑Order & Pickup App

*(Counties & cities from Lubbock northward, stopping where the prior Panhandle file begins)*

This document mirrors the prior Panhandle scan and **highlights only the strongest, most visible candidates** — markets, organizers, and permitting bodies that already coordinate multi‑vendor selling and pickup-style activity.

## How to Read This
- **Bold entity names** = strong outreach candidates
- 🟢 = very strong fit (direct preorder + pickup match)

# Recommended Expansion Strategy

1. **Anchor in Lubbock**
   - Downtown Farmers Market + Wolfforth
2. Expand to **Plainview & Levelland**
3. Pull repeat vendors via permits
4. Let vendors carry the app north into Panhandle markets
