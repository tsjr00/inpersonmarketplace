# Implications for InPerson Marketplace (quick takeaways)

## 1) The “preorder + pickup” battleground is already crowded — but fragmented
- Tier 1 competitors tend to be **regional** (FarmDrop, some market-host networks) or **farm-first** apps (Locally Grown, Homegrown).
- Opportunity: be the **vertical-agnostic** engine (farmers markets → fireworks → fairs/shows) with consistent checkout, pickup logic, and vendor onboarding.

## 2) Organizer tools are a partner wedge
- Seen Markets / Marketspread / Manage My Market / ConventionForce are strongly **market-manager-first**.
- If your product can **import vendor rosters / booth maps / schedules** (even via CSV first), you can pitch:
  - “Keep your current organizer tool; add buyer preorder + vendor pack lists + pickup check-in.”

## 3) Differentiators to double down on
- **Pre-sale / deposit** logic and “bundle” mechanics (important for fireworks).
- **Multi-vertical configuration** (your existing pattern: config-driven verticals in the app).
- **Pickup-time-slot orchestration** + line skipping, with market-day scanning/check-in.
- **Vendor confidence**: inventory forecasting, cutoff times, “what to bring” list, and no-shows handling.

## 4) Next best research sprint (fast, practical)
- Build a matrix: *buyer-side ordering*, *multi-vendor cart*, *market-day pickup workflow*, *vendor inventory/pack lists*, *organizer booth fees/maps*, *subscriptions*, *fees*.
- Then test 10–15 markets (TX Panhandle + Lubbock corridor) and ask:
  - “What software do you use today?”  
  - “Do you allow preorders?”  
  - “What would vendors pay for line-skipping + prepay?”  

(If you want, I can generate the matrix as a CSV you can paste into Sheets.)
