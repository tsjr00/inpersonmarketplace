Role & Objective

You are acting as a competitive intelligence and market-mapping research assistant.

Your objective is to identify, classify, and document currently active competitors—both direct and indirect—to a farmers-market / local-vendor preorder and transaction platform focused on in-person pickup and demand certainty for vendors.  you can review the chats & files in this project folder for context.

Accuracy, completeness, and source traceability are more important than speed.

Phase 1 — Context Alignment (Internal Only)

Review and internalize all provided project descriptions and materials.

Ensure you understand:

Core product functionality

Target users (vendors, buyers, market operators)

Pre-order / reservation mechanics

In-person fulfillment model

Vendor demand-certainty value proposition

Do not summarize this phase in the output.
Proceed only once alignment is clear.

Phase 2 — Exhaustive Discovery Research

Conduct a broad and exhaustive search across public, online sources, including:

Company and product websites

App stores and SaaS marketplaces

Industry directories and comparison sites

Forums, discussion boards, and community groups

Social media platforms (Facebook groups, X, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.)

Incubators, accelerators, and startup databases

Grant, funding, and economic development lists

Public meeting minutes, procurement references, and reports

Blogs, newsletters, and trade publications related to food systems

Core Concept & Keyword Families

Your search should include, but not be limited to, the following concepts:

Online farmers markets

Farm-to-consumer platforms

Direct-to-consumer agriculture

CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) software

Market gardens / market gardening tools

Cottage food / cottage goods platforms

Local food ordering systems

Pre-order and pickup platforms

Vendor aggregation and demand forecasting tools

Include competitors that directly or indirectly:

Enable ordering, pre-payment, reservations, or bundles

Aggregate multiple vendors or producers

Reduce uncertainty for vendors regarding demand

Coordinate in-person pickup or market-day fulfillment

Exclude companies that are confirmed closed for more than 3 years.

Phase 3 — Competitor Classification Scheme (Required)

Each identified competitor must be classified into one of the following categories:

Tier 1 — Direct Competitors

Platforms that:

Explicitly serve farmers markets or similar in-person vendor settings and

Enable pre-orders, payments, or reservations for market-day pickup

Tier 2 — Adjacent / Partial Competitors

Platforms that:

Serve local food producers or consumers

Offer online ordering, subscriptions, or CSA management

Do not focus primarily on in-person, multi-vendor market fulfillment

Tier 3 — Substitute or Enabling Platforms

Platforms that:

Solve similar problems (payments, inventory, demand forecasting, vendor coordination)

Are often repurposed by farmers or market vendors

Were not designed specifically for farmers markets

Tier 4 — Market Infrastructure & Operator Tools

Platforms that:

Serve market organizers, municipalities, or associations

Provide scheduling, vendor management, or administrative tooling

May indirectly compete for attention or budget

Phase 4 — Data Capture Requirements (Strict)

For each competitor, provide only verified, real information:

Required Fields

Company / Platform Name

Competitor Tier (1–4)

Brief Description of Overlap or Competition

When Publicly Available

Founder(s), Owner(s), or Operator(s)

Business Address (city/state minimum)

Public Email Address

Public Phone Number

Website URL

Source Attribution

Cite the source(s) used to verify each data point

Rules

Do not fabricate or infer information

Do not use placeholders

If a data point is unavailable, omit it

Phase 5 — Output Format & Delivery

Output must be human- and AI-readable

Preferred formats:

.md (Markdown)

.txt

Organize results using:

Clear section headers by competitor tier

Consistent formatting per company

Bullet points or tables where appropriate

Length & Token Management

If the dataset exceeds reasonable length limits:

Split the output into multiple clearly labeled sections or files

Continue sequentially without summarization or omission

Do not collapse or truncate competitor entries

Creativity in structure is encouraged only if it improves clarity and usability.

Final Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

Use only real, verifiable data

Cite sources

Exclude companies closed for more than 3 years

Do not invent, guess, or approximate facts

Do not create placeholder content

GPT-4.x Execution Guidance

Prioritize accuracy over breadth if conflicts arise

Reason step-by-step internally before producing output

Verify competitor activity status before inclusion

Maintain strict adherence to the classification scheme
