# Counties with LOW Visible Market Signal (Still Worth Later)
Armstrong, Briscoe, Castro, Childress, Collingsworth, Donley, Hall, Hansford, Hartley, Hemphill, Lipscomb, Oldham, Parmer, Roberts, Sherman, Swisher, Wheeler

**Interpretation**
- Low online visibility ≠ no vendors
- Often means:
  - markets run informally
  - churches/chambers host events
  - vendors operate via Facebook

**Strategy**
- Enter through nearby Tier‑1/Tier‑2 markets
- Vendors often cross county lines

---

# Recommended Pilot Strategy (Practical)
1. **Pilot with 1–2 markets**  
   Golden Spread + Canyon OR Borger
2. Use organizer to onboard **10–15 vendors at once**
3. Layer in individual vendors discovered via permits
4. Expand county coverage organically through vendor networks

- Turn this into a **CRM‑ready lead table (CSV)**

Just say the word.
