# Backlog

Last updated: 2026-03-20 (end of Session 62)

## Priority 0 — Next Session

### Stripe Tax Implementation (BLOCKED — needs user action first)
- [ ] **TX Comptroller registration** — Register as marketplace provider, get sales tax permit. USER ACTION.
- [ ] **Stripe Tax registration** — Add Texas in Stripe Dashboard → Tax → Registrations with permit number. USER ACTION.
- [ ] **Get Stripe product tax codes** — Find codes for "prepared food" (taxable) and "food and food ingredients" (exempt). USER ACTION: browse Dashboard → Products → Tax codes, or run `stripe tax_codes list`.
- [ ] **Code: Enable automatic_tax on checkout sessions** — Add `automatic_tax: { enabled: true, liability: { type: 'self' } }` to order, market box, and subscription checkout. Map `is_taxable` to Stripe product tax codes per line item.
- [ ] **Code: Buyer address collection** — Add `shipping_address_collection` or pass pickup location zip for tax jurisdiction determination.
- [ ] **Code: Withhold tax from vendor transfers** — Exclude tax amount from transfer to connected account. Tax stays with platform for remittance.
- [ ] **Code: Track sales_tax_cents** — Add to orders/order_items for internal records + accounting reports.
- [ ] **Filing setup** — Choose: manual filing with Stripe Tax location reports, or TaxJar AutoFile ($35/filing).

### Pre-Launch Business Items
- [ ] **Tax compliance consultation** — Partially done (Session 63 research). Remaining: confirm platform fee taxability, verify filing frequency, confirm marketplace facilitator registration process. CPA recommended.

### Catering Pre-Order System (Session 63 decisions)
- [ ] **Catering minimum order enforcement** — 10 items per vendor minimum for catering orders (`advance_order_days > 0`). Enforce at cart validation AND checkout. Show clear message: "Catering orders require a minimum of 10 items per vendor."
- [ ] **Catering advance notice tiers** — Size-based minimum lead time: 10-29 items = 1 day, 30-49 items = 2 days, 50+ items = 3 days. Enforce in SQL `get_available_pickup_dates()` — the advance window should expand/contract based on cart quantity per vendor. Also enforce at checkout validation.
- [ ] **Listing form advance ordering update** — Current dropdown offers fixed 2-7 days. Needs to reflect the new tier logic. The vendor sets their MAX advance window; the system enforces minimums based on order size. May need rethinking — vendor sets "I accept catering orders" (boolean) and the tiers are platform-enforced, not vendor-chosen.
- [ ] **Event $75 per-truck fee** — Due with 50% deposit when agreement signed/uploaded. Needs: fee calculation in event booking flow, payment capture mechanism, tracking in a fees table or on catering_requests.
- [ ] **Zip code visibility across geographic pages** — Research item from Session 63. All geo-search pages should show what zip they're keyed off of. Changing zip on one should change all. DO NOT change until implications understood (browse page has different fallback logic).

### Session 63 Completed

## Priority 1 — From Session 62

### Notifications & Communication
- [x] **Confirmation email pickup instructions** — DONE Session 62. order_ready notification includes handoff instructions + deep-link to specific order.
- [x] **Vendor expiration notification** — DONE Session 62. Cron Phase 1 now notifies vendor when order expires.
- [ ] **Inventory change notifications (design needed)** — Notify buyers when favorited vendors restock. Design: favorites-only, 15-30 min batch window after last change, max 1 per vendor per buyer per day.
- [ ] **Vendor notification titles i18n** — 20+ vendor notifications use hardcoded English strings. Buyer notifications use `t()`. Should be consistent.
- [x] **Notification deep-linking** — DONE Session 62. All buyer order notifications link to specific order detail page.
- [ ] **Notification click routing review** — 48 actionUrls need review for appropriate destinations. Not a wiring issue — each type's actionUrl needs individual review. Tedious but mechanical.

### Tests — Protect Revenue & Recent Fixes
- [ ] **T-7: External payment fee flow test** — HIGHEST PRIORITY. User said "if it breaks we lose money."
- [ ] **T-2: Refund calculation consistency test** — All 4 refund paths must produce identical amounts.
- [ ] **T-11: Inventory restore vertical awareness test** — FT fulfilled = no restore, FM = restore.
- [ ] **T-3: Tip split protective test** — Confirmed correct, needs protection from accidental changes.

### Business Rules to Document
- [x] **BR-5: Market box missed pickup = no refund** — DONE Session 62. In decisions.md.
- [x] **BR-6: Trial tier = 'free'** — DONE Session 62. In decisions.md.
- [x] **BR-11: FT fulfilled items don't restore inventory** — DONE Session 62. In decisions.md.
- [ ] **BR-4: Event approval prerequisites** — What criteria grants event_approved? Is COI required?
- [ ] **BR-7: Cancellation fee allocation** — No documented percentage for vendor's share.
- [ ] **BR-8: Event headcount range (10-5000)** — Hardcoded, no justification documented.
- [x] **BR-9: Cross-vertical cart isolation** — DONE Session 62. Validation added to add-to-cart API.
- [ ] **BR-10: Radius persistence behavior** — Cookie-only vs profile.

### Investigation Needed
- [x] **E-8/E-9: Cart cross-vertical isolation** — DONE Session 62. Vertical validation added to listing + market box add-to-cart.
- [ ] **E-21: Timezone centralization** — zip_codes table has timezone column. Design centralized utility.
- [x] **E-22: Geocode/browse** — INVESTIGATED Session 62. zip_codes table populated on all 3 envs (33,793 rows). DB lookup should work. Silent fallback is documented in code.
- [ ] **Where-today schedule mismatch** — Need specific example from user to diagnose.

### Small Fixes
- [x] **E-25: UserRole type dedup** — DONE Session 62.
- [x] **E-19: Cart remove endpoint stub** — DONE Session 62. Deleted.

## Priority 1 — From Session 61 (Carried Forward)

### Buyer Premium Upgrade Page

### Notification Click Behavior
- [ ] **Notification click routing review** — Each notification type's actionUrl needs review. Most point to orders list; some should point to dashboard, settings, etc. Tedious but mechanical.

### Translation Gaps
- [ ] **Page-by-page translation audit** — Many items not translated to Spanish.

### Order Lifecycle Monitoring
- [x] **Fix "active orders" count on dashboard** — DONE Session 62.
- [x] **Admin dashboard: stuck orders card** — DONE Session 62. Shows count + open issues link.
- [ ] **Integration test: full order lifecycle** — Test order transitions pending → paid → confirmed → ready → completed.
- [x] **Backfill stuck orders** — DONE Session 62. One-time SQL cleanup applied to all 3 envs.

### Event System
- [x] **Event Phase 1 completion** — DONE Session 62. Per-event vendor menus (event_vendor_listings table, vendor picker on accept, 5-item limit). Event lifecycle statuses (approved → ready → active → review → completed). Migration 094 applied all 3 envs.
- [x] **Event Phase 3: Attendee feedback** — DONE Session 62. EventFeedbackForm component on event page during active/review status.
- [x] **Event Phase 3: Vendor prep reminder** — DONE Session 62. Cron Phase 11 sends 24h-before notification.

- [ ] **Stripe payouts_enabled flag sync** — Investigate why DB flags don't stay current after vendor completes Stripe setup.

### Stripe Cleanup
- [x] **Delete old pebble02 webhook endpoint** — DONE by user Session 62.

## Priority 2 — Soon

- [ ] **Playwright automated smoke tests** — See detailed plan in archive section.
- [ ] **Test push notifications on staging** — Verify web push end-to-end.
- [ ] **Stripe live mode activation** — Switch from test to live keys when ready.
- [ ] **Prod zip_codes seeded** — DONE Session 62. 33,793 rows via CSV import.

## Priority 2.5 — Session 62 Audit Opportunities

- [ ] **Opportunity 1: Buyer Interest Geographic Intelligence Dashboard** — buyer_interests table has data. Admin page showing interests by zip/count/date + CSV export.
- [ ] **Opportunity 2: Vendor Quality System Activation** — Nightly cron generates findings. Zero UI. Vendor dashboard card + admin findings page.
- [ ] **Opportunity 3: Trial-to-Paid Conversion Funnel** — Dashboard banner "Day X of 90", upgrade page context, 7-day pre-expiry notification.
- [ ] **Opportunity 4: Vendor Leads Management UI** — Admin leads page with status tracking, follow-up, demo scheduling.

## Priority 2.6 — Documentation Deep Dives
- [ ] **Area-specific deep dive series** — Internal reference docs across full stack. Topics: Statuses, Dates/Times, Locations, Hours/Schedules, Tiers/Limits, Financial Flows, Auth/Access, Device/Browser.

## Priority 2.7 — Performance & Infrastructure
- [ ] **AC-4: Optimize heavy RLS policies on markets table** — 2 nested EXISTS subqueries per row.
- [ ] **L4: Zod input validation on API routes** — Gradually add Zod schemas.
- [ ] **L6: SMS send logic when push enabled** — Blocked by A2P 10DLC carrier approval.
- [ ] **L2: External cron monitoring** — Deferred post-launch.
- [ ] **RLS: Consolidate multiple permissive policies** — Supabase linter flags 15 tables with multiple OR'd permissive SELECT policies. Consolidate into single comprehensive policies for performance.
- [ ] **RLS: Audit auth.uid() vs (SELECT auth.uid())** — Supabase flags auth RLS initialization plan warnings. Ensure all policies use `(SELECT auth.uid())` pattern.
- [ ] **RLS: Document buyer_interests INSERT policy** — `WITH CHECK (true)` is intentional (public lead capture). Add SQL comment or tighten to require valid email. Not a real vulnerability — API validates and rate-limits.
- [ ] **Auth: Investigate incognito/regular Chrome session conflict** — Admin in incognito got logged out when vendor logged in on regular Chrome (same domain, same Supabase project). Likely Supabase SSR cookie middleware or BroadcastChannel issue. Not blocking (different browsers work). Workaround: use Chrome + Edge for multi-role testing.
- [ ] **Migration 006: Apply to prod** — DONE Session 65. Remove this item.

## Priority 3 — When Time Allows
