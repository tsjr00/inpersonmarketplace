# Build Instructions - Initial Project Review

## Objective
Review the existing folder/file structure and codebase to understand what has been built so far.

## Tasks

### 1. Project Structure Analysis
- Navigate through the directory tree
- Document folder organization
- Identify key files and their purposes
- Note any configuration files, dependencies, or build setup

### 2. Code Review
- Read through existing code files
- Understand the architecture and data flow
- Identify what functionality is already implemented
- Note any incomplete features or TODOs

### 3. Create Session Summary
Create a `Session_Summary.md` file with the following sections:

#### Project Overview
- Brief description of what this app does/will do
- Current development stage

#### Folder Structure
- Visual tree or organized list of directories and key files
- Purpose of each major folder/file

#### Implemented Features
- What's currently working
- Key components/modules that exist

#### Architecture Notes
- Tech stack identified
- How components connect
- Any patterns or frameworks in use

#### Observations
- Code quality/organization
- Potential issues or concerns
- Incomplete sections

#### Questions for Chet
- What needs clarification about intent or design
- Suggestions for next steps

## Deliverable
Save your findings as `Session_Summary.md` in the project root (or designated output location).

## Note
This is a READ-ONLY review. Don't modify any existing files during this task.
