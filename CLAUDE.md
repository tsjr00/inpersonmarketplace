# Claude Code Project Rules

## Error Resolution System - USE BEFORE FIXING ANY ERROR

The `error_resolutions` table in Supabase tracks attempted fixes and their outcomes.

### BEFORE Attempting Any Fix:
```sql
-- Check if this error type has been addressed before
SELECT error_code, attempted_fix, status, failure_reason, migration_file
FROM error_resolutions
WHERE error_code LIKE '%KEYWORD%'  -- e.g., '%RLS%', '%recursion%', '%policy%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### AFTER Each Fix Attempt:
Document what was tried, whether it worked, and why:
```sql
INSERT INTO error_resolutions (
  error_code,
  attempted_fix,
  migration_file,
  code_changes,
  status,
  failure_reason,
  verification_method,
  created_by
) VALUES (
  'ERR_XXX_001',           -- Categorized error code
  'Description of fix',    -- What was attempted
  '20260130_007_xxx.sql',  -- Migration file if applicable
  'Summary of changes',    -- Code/policy changes made
  'verified',              -- 'pending', 'verified', 'failed', 'partial'
  NULL,                    -- Reason if failed
  'manual',                -- How it was verified
  'Claude'                 -- Who made the fix
);
```

### Error Code Categories:
- `ERR_RLS_XXX` - Row Level Security issues
- `ERR_PERF_XXX` - Performance warnings
- `ERR_SEC_XXX` - Security warnings
- `ERR_SCHEMA_XXX` - Schema/column issues
- `ERR_AUTH_XXX` - Authentication issues

### Why This Matters:
- Prevents repeating failed approaches
- Documents what works for specific error patterns
- Enables future developers (human or AI) to learn from past fixes

## RLS Policy Changes - MANDATORY PROCESS

Before ANY migration that touches RLS policies:

### 1. Audit Existing State
```bash
# List all policies created across all migrations
cd supabase/migrations && grep -h "CREATE POLICY" *.sql | sed 's/.*CREATE POLICY "\([^"]*\)".* ON.*\.\([a-z_]*\).*/\2: \1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

If a policy has been created multiple times, it indicates duplicates that need cleanup.

### 2. Check for Existing Policies on Target Tables
Before creating ANY policy, search migrations for existing policies on that table:
```bash
grep -l "public.TABLE_NAME" supabase/migrations/*.sql
```

### 3. Always DROP Before CREATE
Every `CREATE POLICY` must have a corresponding `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` first.

### 4. Performance Rules
- ALWAYS use `(SELECT auth.uid())` instead of `auth.uid()`
- Use `SECURITY DEFINER` helper functions for complex checks to avoid recursion
- Minimize policies per table - use `FOR ALL` when the same logic applies

### 5. Avoid Recursion
- NEVER call `is_platform_admin()` in policies on `user_profiles` (causes recursion)
- Use `service_role` grants for admin operations instead of RLS policies
- Use `SECURITY DEFINER` helper functions that bypass RLS when querying RLS-protected tables

### 6. One Migration, Complete Fix
Don't create incremental policy fixes. If policies need fixing:
1. Audit ALL policies on ALL affected tables
2. Create ONE comprehensive migration that drops all and recreates correctly
3. Test thoroughly before committing

## Migration File Naming
Format: `YYYYMMDD_NNN_description.sql`
- Use sequential numbers (001, 002, etc.) within each day
- Keep descriptions short but meaningful

## Commit Messages for Migrations
Include:
- What tables are affected
- What issue is being fixed
- Co-author line for Claude
