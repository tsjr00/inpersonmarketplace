RAW CUSTOMER DISCOVERY INTERVIEW NOTES:

this morning I went and did some in person customer discovery and market research I'm going to read back to you my notes from those conversations and interactions and then I need you to help me to organize common thoughts, common resources, trends, methods, etc. and put them into a list of potential learning items, action items, things that are important for us to note and understand, and then this information is going to be used to help us craft part of our go to market strategy 

• the first vendor was a bread cellar they use an app called simply bread they receive preorders through the app that has the ability to take a pre-order and have it prepaid or take a pre-order and mark it as unpaid that so that cash has to be received later the company does not have a website they use cash app Venmo and square they have a small square machine that they can tap to pay or insert the chip they do a mix of cash and card sales for inventory they use storage coolers they're unmarked and the owner runs the booth themselves and spends a good amount of time interacting with each person creating that face to face bond she runs everything through her phone her whole business is run through her phone and she markets on all the social media platforms she would like to have a website but she's not exactly sure what she's going to do with it

• the next vendor is a company to family that sells place mats doormats metal signs and they are they have a machine or equipment to the custom print anything that they want onto the doormats or metal signs so they only have digital inventory and then blank slate physical inventory when they receive an order then they billed to suit for that particular order they they have a website they use the website and they receive orders from it sometimes they receive the website order and then they bring the physical item to the market and sometimes they ship the item to the purchasers they use social media for marketing one of the things that they enjoy about the coming to the market in person is they hear what types of ideas people want and so that gives them new ideas about what images to have available to print onto their items they use Venmo and square for their payment in person they do quite a bit of business she said through Etsy and they use Etsy to mark it they pay the fees for Etsy they use Etsy to print shipping labels and they pay for the shipping through the Etsy platform they also use Pinterest and one of the things that they like most about Etsy is that they see the numbers the analytics for their Etsy store and it's easy for them to understand and manage they have a tablet that they run their booth with and that's it

• The next vendor is a Baker they are new to the market they've only been there three weeks but their market looks good their booth looks good they said that they started baking and selling as part of a fundraiser and that went so well they decided to try to make money at it so they use venmo cash app and PayPal for their payment options they use AI to create their labels and logo and then they print them the Canva.  They have regular black and white labels that they use for their cottage act labeling requirements they have a banner that shows their cottage act registration number and I think it would be a good thing for us to allow our vendors to include their cottage act registration number on their vendor profile

• OK the next vendor is a guy who sells beef jerky and his business is predominantly it's a mix of drop in person to person sales and business to business sales and markets so he will go from business to business and give away samples of beef jerky and then ask the company if that company would like to order any beef jerky as a treat for their staff or if it's a retail store he asks if they would be interested in reselling his beef jerky he does predominantly in person sales and at the market he has a very small booth with the simple table set U where he gives away free samples and has three sizes of jerky and four flavors so Max of 12 products for him he wants to be online he wants to have a website and wants to sell online but he doesn't feel that he has enough clients yet

• the next vendor was a family operation of a brother and sister-in-law who sell cotton candy they have a website but they don't use it much they create their logos and graphics and Photoshop they take payments with cash app and Venmo and they receive cash they sell at the market but they also do a variety of events like fairs and festivals holiday markets things where people will want some experience in association with the product so they will spin cotton candy live at an event and sell that way they do their marketing through both the events that they're at and through Facebook they want to grow but internally are still figuring out the economics and mechanics of growth
• the next vendor was an engraving company this lady runs the business from her home she has an established website where she takes orders for either custom engraving where she provides the materials or where people will drop off an item and she will do custom engraving onto it the market is a way for her to increase her visibility to get larger jobs that she does with her equipment her equipment is capable of doing advanced work but there's not enough advanced work to keep the machine busy so she does small items that she can sell at the market to increase awareness of her capability to do larger items she takes payments by credit card Venmo cash app PayPal PayPal all of the payment apps as well as cash markets predominantly on Facebook and Instagram and she's not that concerned about making a lot of money at the market she wants to make a little bit of money and then raise awareness for her larger jobs that she can do

• the next vendor is a bread and sweet maker predominantly cinnamon rolls sweet breads things like that it's a family operation with a mother and two daughters they run the business off of an iPad and they use peel and stick Avery labels for their product labels and they use the builtin Avery software for those labels they mark it predominantly on Facebook and she has several repeat customers from the small town that she is in she is in Wheeler Texas and she drives to Amarillo to do the booth every week and she has consistent customers who will order breads and sweet rolls and then either come pick them up or she meets them if it's in town very often she will post her items to Facebook and then she will take orders via Facebook Messenger and she will get paid via cash app or Venmo or she will at least take a deposit via cash app or Venmo or if the person promises that they will be at the market she will just take the order and wait for them to pay cash she's not concerned about getting no shows for product items or product orders because she feels confident that she can sell them at the market what I just described with the selling on Facebook receiving the orders in messenger is very common many of the vendors described that as their common scenario and they go to market to meet new clients to gain exposure and to provide a location for people to pick up items that they ordered online so she doesn't have to do deliveries she takes cash app and Venmo her internal systems are still pencil and paper and she has a big white board that she writes her orders down on to keep things organized she does a lot of business around the holidays and we'll go to events as well to increase sales and traffic

• the next vendor was a lady who does baked goods predominantly cakes cookies and cupcakes but she also SOS and does other craft items whatever she is interested in and she will make as much as she feels is necessary or as much as she is interested in and then she sells it and then moves on to the next thing which does not have a consistent inventory of craft items it changes based upon what she likes making but the baking is the consistent side of her business she has a website she uses it predominantly for marketing and to show pictures of the things that she has made and can make but because many of the jobs are custom or require custom decoration she sends people to the website to get an idea what they want then she has a conversation to get the details for the custom order she uses square on her phone to take credit cards she takes preorders via Facebook and Facebook Messenger especially around the holidays she uses all of the social media platforms for marketing and she takes all payment apps in addition to credit cards

• the next vendor I talked to was a glass blower and glass creator he uses a fundraiser platform called cheddar U as a way to have an online profile that links all of his social media sites and he tries to drive traffic to that website or that profile he also uses a bit digital business card called dot and he wears uh a dongle or a bracelet that uses near field technology to point people to his dot profile and give them his contact information and all of the socials but it's slow and clunky and doesn't feel that professional it does have all of his socials in one place but it's not really effective marketing he goes to the market to help visually show what he's capable of and then he hopes to sell some small items and start a conversation about larger items he can custom make for people that's where he hopes to make most of his money he would like to have a website and likes the idea of selling online but he does not push online sales right now he takes PayPal and cash app he says that if he was going to create a website he would use Squarespace and he likes the he chose the cheddar up platform which is really a fundraising platform for schools but he chose it because it's cheap 

• the next vendor I talked to makes wood and epoxy items that he spins on a lathe so he makes plates bowls he makes pen barrels for custom pens he makes platters that he can spin on the lathe and cut into interesting designs he uses his phone or in his business and a notebook he takes cash and cash a and he has a tote that he loads everything up into and is a simple operation and is intimidated by technology

• the next vendor I talked to was the sourdough bread maker she used to use the simply bread app but didn't like how it worked and so she switched to having her own website but she does not take orders through the website she uses it just for marketing she uses all the social media platforms for marketing she will generally run her business in a similar way a food truck runs so at the beginning of the week she posts her menu what she's making for the week and where she will be during that week she then receives orders through the social media platform And sometimes she receives prepayment but most of the time she will just accept the pre-order and arrange to meet with somebody via the social media platform she also does events any community fair rodeo craft market all different types of events she will set up bring her products and she knows that's happening and ahead of time and so she puts that out onto her social media feeds and then monitors those incoming orders and I think she she must bake to fill those orders she says she has regular recurring customers and that they will travel to pick up the items that they order it occurs to me though that she may be spending a lot of time monitoring her socials for her orders one of the things that she said she would like to have is a farmers market app that shows where she will be and but she will have she also mentioned that she would put a link to that on her social media feeds and that way people could find her via that one platform she also stressed the importance that the vendor community is and the importance of the person to person transactions the bread is a side business for her it's becoming profitable and she would like for it to be a full time job


AFTER CHETs STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:

OK so here are my notes as I'm looking at your strategic analysis let's dig into some of these payment reality check yes I agree um stripe is technically a better vendor but they don't know that and it may be harder to convince them so what's our plan to incorporate cash app Venmo and PayPal what are the technical specs necessary and what conflicts if any exist with integrating with these other platforms while we also have an integration with stripe?  

Regarding social media as an order channel yes we cannot ignore it because that's where their comfort zone is and so integrating with it is much better idea for the where will where will I be problem that you're posing I think with the the fact that we have private pickup locations we don't have a a schedule page but we can have because like right now we have a section that says private pickup available but instead of just saying we have private pickup available what if we make that we build that out a little bit further and so we incorporate a schedule and the private pickup locations we already have that data maybe we just need to format it and put a little title on it that says maybe it says here's where I am this week or this week's pickup availability and they can list their maybe we do like a column almost like a calendar look so there's Sunday through Saturday 7 columns and then there's the or maybe that would take up a lot more room so we just stick with the listing of private pickup location and then next to it Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday you know whatever the days that they're there maybe that's where we do the grid so we have a private pickup location on the list and then next to it there's like a little grid type thing where we can have the abbreviations for the days of the week and then an axe or a check mark to show where they will be that that week and they can go in and update that on the private pickup management because we have a board we have a screen where they can manage that and they don't have to change it from week to week but if they have a special event pop up then they can add another location for that special event so we'll have to look at may be expanding the number of private pickup locations maybe even expanding the number of markets that they have but I think we've got the bones of the page structure and the technology built so that we can we can make that work 

Regarding the market strategies pattern #2 increased visibility and I saw elsewhere that you had the idea of QR codes for walk up boots visitors um I think that good yeah that that could be certainly part of it where if we can generate a QR code that the the vendor can copy or download and that becomes the link to their vendor profile and they can put that on their socials along with a link or they can have that as a walk up that was something I saw predominantly as a lot of people had the cash app QR codes and things like that um but if they have another larger business or they have other things on their profile then that could be an element to help drive traffic back to our platform from the market so maybe somebody at the market says ohh I'm not always here but I'd I'd like to see what other stuff you have they could say well just check out my profile I'm here on this app - And that certainly also works for drop in sales that they're going somewhere instead of just leaving a card that says message me on Facebook if they left them a flyer or something where they had a QR code that can take them right to their vendor profile page and our app then that business or restaurant or whoever can order directly from their profile page

OK so regarding pattern #3 that you're mentioning where the market is a pickup location for social orders how do we bridge that gap?  If they are taking orders via Facebook and they're coming in the messenger what is the bridge how do we get them to move those clients over to ordering with our platform instead of just responding to a Facebook post?

I do like the idea that you pose here under the website reality section that you mention where instead of trying to take the place of their website and us be their marketing and portfolio obviously we can help with some marketing but we don't want to overload the system with tons of pictures they've already got a website and Facebook for stuff like that that's where they get their social interaction and build that customer base but if they can link to our platform to their vendor profile from the website or from the social media if they link right to their vendor profile then that will have the the things that they're trying to sell.  Ohh I think this is worth investigating further and and seeing what that looks like - We have vendor analytics at least the UI built out and I think the basic back end analytics are built to track but those really need to be tested because if we could help people help vendors see what's getting the most action what's getting the most views and most sales then that could be valuable data to help them build their business not just market and hope.   I don't really want to get into the shipping part I don't think that's enough of the market because we don't have contracts with FedEx and UPS and Postal Service and things like that but if all it was was printing a shipping label we could probably do that pretty easily but I don't want to get too far into any type of shipping integration.

So one of the things that I had heard from several vendors is that they're willing to take preorders online currently a lot of that is through Facebook Messenger which we have to deal with but they're willing to take preorders online without repayment, now obviously everybody would prefer repayment but I think they have the idea that requiring prepayment will reduce the number of orders we may be able to do some type of education and marketing around that but we may also just want to check into some type of mechanism whereby we allow in order to be placed through the platform that will be a cash pay in person and then maybe we have the same type of user interface where the person walks up and shows that here's the order but it's a it's a different screen color like maybe it's yellow if they need to pay in cash and so the the so here's my order and the vendor says ohh OK yeah I've got it over here looks like you owe me X dollars and then they can can deal with that but maybe if that transaction happens through the a then when the transaction is confirmed or fulfilled in person on the back end we take are platform percentage out of the vendor side or maybe there is an invoice that they have to pay for platform fees for those preorders that paid cash I think we can figure out the technology on that because we have that in person 32nd window and if the vendor does not tap fulfill then within a few minutes there is a remember it's several hours later but there's a time at which access to other orders and things is blocked and so even if they confirm all the orders for their market time then later on in the day they go back and they fulfill all those orders afterward or maybe they skipped them during the market but they confirmed them all later then at that time they get assessed a fee for the dollar amount that was on the listing price I think we can manage that technically and obviously we'd have to reduce the fees on that because it's not going through stripe and they're not paying the percentage but I think that's an option where we could let people preorder online and pay cash in person and we can still get paid and maybe because it's going to be a cash transaction we round the amount up or down to the nearest you know amount um the nearest 25 and then so the vendor can mess around with the price so they can charge the right amount so that it's it shows up as a clean dollar figure for the person who's going to hand them cash can we can we can consider that but I think it is important that we find a way to be an easy option the easiest option for preorders and local pickup - So what does what would it look like to incorporate the Venmo or cash app into our platform that's a big question but what if there was a workaround where maybe on the vendors profile we let them put their QR codes for their cash app or their Venmo ohh or maybe when somebody chooses pay with cash app or pay with Venmo and they so we have a different checkout process so it's not the traditional cart or maybe it is the traditional cart I don't know the technical specifications but what I'm thinking is when somebody adds to the cart maybe they somewhere on that product detail screen there's a list of check boxes or something available where they say pay with cash app a with Venmo pay with credit card and then based upon that the appropriate checkout process is shown so if they say pay with credit card then the stripe button add to cart becomes available or if they say pay with or maybe this happens in the shopping cart before we hand it off to the payment processor they add things to their shopping cart and then when they say pay it doesn't just go to stripe we if they say if they have all the options there for all the different payment apps and they say hey with Venmo then that vendors Venmo QR code becomes visible so I don't know what that works technically because I think right now the shopping cart is kind of a it's a yeah we got we also have multiple vendors who can go into one cart but if there was a way 4 the vendor to upload an image of their cash app QR code or their Venmo QR code or PayPal or whatever that their customers are used to paying with and then we show that QR code on the screen or the link to their cash app checkout however that technology works so we have multiple ways for the the user to or the buyer to pay the user and if it's related to stripe then obviously they get the benefit of all the back end stuff but if it's not if it's one of those other things we have to explore what that looks like so let's dig into that tell me what options are technically viable and not viable and what are the risks if any associated with that

OK regarding things to do that we know we're going to do um we need to add a cottage foods registration field to the vendor dashboard vendor profile so they can but their cottage food registration number in there they can the and then if they got a registration they can have the cottage food badge like on their profile so they're registered that matters um we're going to explore the idea of putting a weekly schedule next to each of the private pick up locations we're going to generate shareable links for product so they can share those out to socials and put them in other places We're going to put a QR code generator somewhere into the system so vendors can have a QR code that links back to their profile they can put out their vendor booth.
