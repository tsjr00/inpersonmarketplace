## Is Selling at Farmers Markets Right for You? {#is-it-right}

Before investing time and money, honestly evaluate whether farmers market vending fits your goals, personality, and lifestyle.

### Time Commitment Reality Check

**Part-time vendors (1 market per week):**
- Production: 8-15 hours
- Market day: 4-6 hours
- Prep and cleanup: 3-5 hours
- **Total: 15-25 hours per week**

**Full-time vendors (4+ markets per week):**
- Production: 25-40 hours
- Market days: 16-24 hours
- Prep, planning, admin: 10-15 hours
- **Total: 50-70 hours per week**

Farmers markets happen on weekends when most people have time off. If weekend family time is sacred, this may not be the right fit.

### Startup Cost Breakdown

Most new vendors invest between $500 and $2,000 to start:

**Essential Equipment ($300-$800):**
- Canopy tent: $150-$400
- Tables and displays: $100-$300
- Cash box and change: $100
- Signage and business cards: $50-$100

**Legal and Permits ($50-$300):**
- Market application fees: $25-$50 per market
- Business registration: $0-$100 (varies by state)
- Sales tax permit: Usually free
- Insurance: $300-$800 annually (often required)

**Initial Inventory ($100-$500):**
- Ingredients for first batch
- Packaging materials
- Labels

**Technology (Optional but Recommended):**
- Payment card reader: $0 upfront (Square, Stripe charge per transaction)
- Pre-order platform: $0 upfront (farmersmarketing.app charges 6.5% per order)

### Personality Fit Assessment

**You'll thrive if you:**
- Enjoy talking with strangers and telling your story
- Handle rejection gracefully (not everyone will buy)
- Stay patient during slow periods
- Work well in all weather conditions
- Adapt quickly when things don't go as planned

**This might not be for you if you:**
- Prefer working alone without customer interaction
- Get frustrated by unpredictable income
- Struggle with early mornings (markets often start at 7-8 AM)
- Need consistent, predictable schedules

### Success Rate Expectations

Industry data shows mixed results:
- 30% of new vendors quit after their first season
- 40% continue for 2-3 years
- 30% build sustainable long-term businesses

The difference? Those who succeed typically:
- Price their products properly (not too low)
- Use pre-orders to reduce waste
- Treat it as a real business with proper planning
- Start small and scale gradually

**Self-Assessment Question:** Can you make a profit selling 20-30 units per market day at your target price? If not, reconsider your product or pricing strategy before launching.

## Understanding Legal Requirements {#legal-requirements}

Legal compliance varies significantly by state, county, and product type. Getting this right from the start prevents costly problems later.

### Cottage Food Laws: The Starting Point for Most Vendors

If you're making food in your home kitchen, cottage food laws are likely your path forward.

**What Cottage Food Laws Allow:**
- Making certain low-risk foods in your home kitchen
- Selling directly to consumers (not to restaurants or stores)
- Operating without a commercial kitchen license
- Annual revenue caps ($25,000 to $125,000 depending on state)

**What Cottage Food Laws Typically Prohibit:**
- Refrigerated or frozen items (dairy, cream fillings, fresh pasta)
- Meat products (jerky excepted in some states)
- Home-canned vegetables or low-acid foods
- Selling to restaurants or retailers for resale

**Common Cottage Food Products:**
- Baked goods (breads, cookies, brownies, cakes without cream filling)
- Jams, jellies, and fruit preserves
- Dried herbs and seasonings
- Candy and confections
- Granola and trail mix
- Dried fruits
- Popcorn and nuts

**Texas Example (Your State Will Differ):**
- Revenue limit: $50,000 per year
- No license or registration required
- No home kitchen inspection
- Specific label disclaimer required
- Can sell at farmers markets, from home, at temporary events
- Cannot sell online with shipping

→ **Action Item:** Check our [state-by-state cottage food database](/resources/legal/cottage-food-laws) for your specific state's rules.

### Business Registration Requirements

**Do you need a business license?**
Most states don't require a state-level business license for sole proprietors, but you may need:

**DBA ("Doing Business As") Registration:**
- Required if using a business name other than your personal name
- Filed with your county clerk's office
- Cost: $25-$100 depending on county
- Protects your business name locally

**Sales Tax Permit:**
- Required in most states to collect sales tax
- Usually free to register
- Obtained from your state comptroller or revenue department
- Mandatory even for small cottage food operations

**Food Handler Certification:**
- Required by some states and many markets
- Online courses available for $10-$30
- Takes 2-3 hours to complete
- Valid for 2-5 years depending on state

**Example Registration Costs:**
- Texas: DBA $26 (Amarillo area) + Sales tax permit (free) + Food Handler $7 = **$33 total**
- California: Cottage food registration $75 + Sales tax permit (free) + Food Handler $15 = **$90 total**

### Insurance: Not Optional

Most farmers markets require proof of general liability insurance, typically $1 million coverage.

**Why Insurance Matters:**
- Protects you if someone claims illness from your product
- Covers slip-and-fall accidents at your booth
- Required by 90% of established farmers markets
- Often required to sell on private property

**Cost:**
- General liability: $300-$500 per year
- Product liability (food-specific): $400-$800 per year
- Combined policies often available

**Where to Get Insurance:**
- ACT Insurance (cottage food specialist)
- Farmer's Market Legal
- State Farm, Nationwide (general business policies)

**Pro Tip:** Some farmers markets include liability insurance in vendor fees, but this is rare. Always ask before assuming you're covered.

### Health Department Requirements

**Home Kitchen Rules (Cottage Food):**
- Most states don't inspect home kitchens for cottage food
- You're responsible for following safe food handling practices
- Your home must be your primary residence
- Can't employ workers in home kitchen (family members usually OK)

**Commercial Kitchen Requirements:**
If you exceed cottage food revenue limits or want to make prohibited foods:
- Rent licensed commercial kitchen space ($15-$40/hour typical)
- Or build your own ($25,000-$100,000+ investment)
- Health department inspections required
- More extensive permits and fees

### Labeling Requirements

Every cottage food product needs a label with:

**Required Information:**
- Product name
- Ingredient list (descending order by weight)
- Allergen warnings (if contains milk, eggs, nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish)
- Net weight or volume
- Your name and address (business or home)
- Cottage food disclaimer (state-specific wording)

**Texas Disclaimer Example:**
"This food is made in a home kitchen and is not inspected by the Department of State Health Services or a local health department."

**Label Cost:**
- Print at home: $0.05-$0.15 per label
- Professional printing: $0.25-$0.50 per label for custom designs
- Online templates available free

### Legal Compliance Checklist

Before your first market:
- [ ] Research cottage food laws in your state
- [ ] Register business name (DBA) if using business name
- [ ] Obtain sales tax permit
- [ ] Complete food handler certification (if required)
- [ ] Purchase liability insurance ($1M minimum)
- [ ] Create compliant product labels
- [ ] Understand what you can and cannot sell
- [ ] Know your annual revenue limit

**Total compliance cost:** Typically $350-$900 first year (mostly insurance)

## Choosing What to Sell {#choosing-products}

Product selection determines your profitability, production demands, and competitive position. Choose wisely.

### The Three-Factor Decision Framework

**Factor 1: What Can You Produce Consistently?**

Ask yourself:
- Can I make this product the same quality every single time?
- Can I produce enough volume for weekly markets?
- Do I have adequate kitchen space and equipment?
- Can I source ingredients reliably year-round?

**Red flags:**
- "I'll figure out production as I go"
- Recipes that only work sometimes
- Seasonal ingredients with no backup plan
- Production methods that don't scale

**Factor 2: What Does the Market Need?**

Research your target markets:
- Visit as a customer for 3-4 weeks
- Count vendors by category (how many bread vendors? jam vendors?)
- Note what sells out quickly
- Observe what customers ask for but can't find

**Oversaturated categories** (be cautious):
- Jam and jelly (almost every market has 3-5 vendors)
- Basic cookies (high competition)
- Generic baked goods without differentiation

**Undersaturated opportunities:**
- Gluten-free or allergen-free specialties
- Ethnic or specialty foods
- Hard-to-find ingredients
- Products with unique local ingredients

**Factor 3: What Provides Good Profit Margins?**

Calculate your costs realistically:
- Ingredient cost per unit
- Labor time at $20/hour (your time has value!)
- Packaging and labeling
- Allocated market fees and transportation

**High-margin products** (50-70% typical):
- Baked goods with common ingredients
- Granola and snack mixes
- Dried herbs and seasonings
- Candy and confections

**Medium-margin products** (40-50% typical):
- Preserves and jams
- Fresh baked bread
- Specialty cookies and pastries

**Lower-margin products** (30-40% typical):
- Fresh produce
- Items requiring expensive ingredients
- Products with very short shelf life

→ **Use our [pricing calculator](/resources/calculators/pricing) to test profitability before committing.**

### The "Start Simple, Add Later" Strategy

**Week 1-4:** Sell 3 core products
- Master production and quality

## Pricing Your Products for Profit {#pricing-strategy}

Underpricing is the #1 mistake new vendors make. Price properly from day one.

### The Real Cost of Your Products

Most new vendors forget to include these costs:

**Direct Costs (Obvious):**
- Ingredients
- Packaging (jars, bags, boxes, labels)
- Recipe testing and waste

**Labor Costs (Often Forgotten):**
- Production time (baking, cooking, assembling)
- Setup and breakdown at market
- Shopping for ingredients
- Bookkeeping and admin

**Value your time at minimum $20/hour.** If you're making $10/hour selling your products, you're better off getting a job at Target.

**Overhead Costs (Allocated Per Unit):**
- Market fees ($25/week ÷ 30 units sold = $0.83/unit)
- Transportation and gas ($15/market ÷ 30 units = $0.50/unit)
- Equipment depreciation (tent lasts 3 years, cost per use)
- Insurance (annual cost allocated across all sales)
- Platform fees (6.5% of sale price for farmersmarketing.app)

### Cost-Plus Pricing Formula

**Step 1:** Calculate cost per unit

Example - Blueberry Jam (8oz jar):
- Blueberries: $1.20
- Sugar, pectin, lemon: $0.40
- Jar and lid: $0.75
- Label: $0.10
- Labor (45 min @ $20/hr for 6 jars): $2.50 ÷ 6 = $0.42
- Allocated market fee: $0.40
- Allocated gas: $0.25
- **Total cost per jar: $3.52**

**Step 2:** Add desired profit margin

- 40% margin: $3.52 ÷ 0.60 = **$5.87** (round to $6)
- 50% margin: $3.52 ÷ 0.50 = **$7.04** (round to $7)
- 60% margin: $3.52 ÷ 0.40 = **$8.80** (round to $9)

**Step 3:** Check against market prices

Research what similar jams sell for at your target markets:
- Basic jam: $6-$7
- Premium/specialty jam: $8-$10
- Artisan small-batch: $10-$12

**Step 4:** Choose your positioning

- Budget option: $6 (40% margin - sustainable but tight)
- Standard pricing: $7-$8 (50% margin - healthy and competitive)
- Premium positioning: $9-$10 (60% margin - requires quality differentiation)

**Recommendation:** Start at 50% margin ($7-$8 for this jam). Test customer response. Raise prices if you sell out every week.

### Pricing Psychology at Farmers Markets

**Price Points That Work:**
- $5, $6, $7, $8, $10, $12, $15
- **Avoid:** $4.99, $7.99 (seems cheap/commercial)

**Why?** Farmers market customers expect round numbers and associate penny prices with grocery stores.

**Bundle Pricing:**
- "3 for $18" (=$6 each) feels better than "$6 each"
- "2 for $12" encourages larger purchases
- Quantity discounts reward loyal customers

**Early Market vs Late Market Pricing:**
- Some vendors discount in final hour to clear inventory
- Others maintain price but offer "deal of the day" on select items
- **Don't** train customers to wait for discounts

### Common Pricing Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Competing on price**
- Other vendor sells cookies for $5, so you charge $4.50
- Result: Race to the bottom, nobody profits
- **Better:** Differentiate on quality, story, or variety

**Mistake #2: Forgetting to value your labor**
- "Ingredients only cost $2, so I'll charge $4"
- Result: Working for $3/hour
- **Better:** Include labor at realistic wage

**Mistake #3: Pricing based on fear**
- "Nobody will pay $8 for jam"
- Result: Underpricing from day one
- **Better:** Test the market, let customers decide

**Mistake #4: Never raising prices**
- Started at $6 three years ago, still $6 today
- Result: Inflation erodes profitability
- **Better:** Annual price reviews, 5-10% increases when justified

### When to Raise Your Prices

**Green lights for price increases:**
- You sell out every single week
- Customers don't negotiate or ask for discounts
- Ingredient costs have increased significantly
- Other vendors raised their prices
- You've improved quality or presentation

**How to raise prices:**
- 5-10% increase typical ($6 → $7 or $8 → $9)
- Announce ahead: "New prices starting next month"
- Some customers will grumble - that's normal
- Most won't notice or care if quality is there

**When NOT to raise prices:**
- You're already struggling to sell current inventory
- New competitor entered market at lower price
- Market traffic is declining
- Your products aren't selling out

### Using farmersmarketing.app Pricing Features

- Set different prices for different markets (affluent suburb vs working-class neighborhood)
- Pre-order discounts (5% off for advance orders)
- Flash sale pricing (limited-time, limited-quantity deals)
- Standing order discounts (reward regular customers)

**Signage Placement:**
- **Business name:** Top/center of booth, visible from 20 feet
- **Prices:** Next to each product group
- **Specials:** Front and center when running deals

**Traffic Flow:**
- Most customers enter from right (plan accordingly)
- Place bestsellers on right side of booth
- Loss leaders (attention-getters) up front

### Booth Display Ideas by Product Type

**Baked Goods:**
- Tiered display for different products
- Baskets lined with cloth napkins
- Glass jars or containers (shows freshness)
- Samples readily available

**Jams and Preserves:**
- Grouped by flavor family (berry, stone fruit, citrus)
- Jars on risers for visibility
- Open jar with spoon for sampling
- Pairing suggestions (great with cheese, yogurt, etc.)

**Produce:**
- Wooden crates or baskets (rustic farm aesthetic)
- Smaller quantities create "fresh-picked" feel
- Signage showing variety names and characteristics
- Restock frequently (always looks abundant)

**Pro Tip:** Take a photo of your best booth setup. Reference it each week for consistency.

- Print order sheets and receipts (if using)
- Charge phone and card reader
- Set alarm (arrive 1-2 hours before market opens)
- Get good sleep (you'll need energy!)

### Market Day Morning Timeline

**2 hours before market opens:**
- Arrive at market
- Unload vehicle (minimal trips - use cart/wagon)
- Set up tent FIRST (provides shade while setting up)
- Weight tent immediately (before adding products)

**1.5 hours before:**
- Set up tables and tablecloths
- Arrange display (refer to your booth photo)
- Price everything clearly
- Organize products logically

**1 hour before:**
- Final visual check (step back, see customer view)
- Test card reader
- Set out business cards
- Prepare samples if offering
- Check with neighbors (introduce yourself!)

**30 minutes before:**
- Deep breath - you've got this
- Review your "elevator pitch" (who you are, what makes you special)
- Position yourself to greet customers
- Smile and relax!

### During Market: Best Practices

**Greeting Customers:**
- Make eye contact and smile
- **Good:** "Good morning! Welcome to [Your Business Name]!"
- **Avoid:** "Can I help you?" (sounds pushy)
- **Avoid:** Staring at phone or being distracted

**Telling Your Story:**
Customers buy from people, not just products. Have a 30-second story ready:

"Hi! I'm Sarah, and I make small-batch sourdough bread using a 100-year-old starter from my great-grandmother's farm in Hill Country. Everything is naturally leavened and hand-shaped - no commercial yeast or preservatives. My bestsellers are the rosemary olive and cinnamon raisin."

**Answering Common Questions:**
- "Is this gluten-free?" → Know your ingredients
- "Where do you source ingredients?" → Be specific
- "Can I try a sample?" → Have samples ready
- "Do you have [product]?" → If not, take note for next time

**Handling Objections:**
- **Price too high:** Don't defend or apologize. "I use premium ingredients and make everything by hand in small batches. The quality speaks for itself - would you like to try a sample?"
- **Already bought from competitor:** "I understand! If you have room for another loaf next week, I'd love for you to compare quality."
- **Just browsing:** "Take your time! I'm right here if you have questions."

**Managing Slow Periods:**
- Straighten display
- Engage neighboring vendors
- Walk around market (see what's working for others)
- **Don't:** Sit behind table on phone (looks disengaged)

**Collecting Customer Information:**
- Email signup sheet or tablet
- Offer incentive: "Sign up for our email list and get first access to pre-orders"
- QR code to farmersmarketing.app store (easy for customers to save)

**Handling Money:**
- Count change twice (mistakes happen)
- Keep large bills hidden (security)
- $20 is most common (have plenty of change)
- Card payments are easier but have backup cash plan

**If You Sell Out Early:**
- Great problem to have! Celebrate success
- Take pre-orders for next week (farmersmarketing.app makes this easy)
- Don't pack up and leave early (market rules + looks bad)
- Network with other vendors

### After Market: Evaluation

**Pack Up Systematically:**
- Save products first (temperature-sensitive items to cooler)
- Break down displays
- Take down tent last (provides shade)
- Leave booth space clean

**Count Your Money:**
- Separate cash from starting change
- Count all cash sales
- Tally card reader transactions
- Total gross revenue

**Evaluate Performance:**
- What sold well?
- What didn't sell?
- What did customers ask for that you didn't have?
- Price feedback (too high, too low, just right?)
- What would you change next week?

**Follow Up:**
- Thank customers via email
- Post photos on social media
- Tag the market and neighboring vendors
- Announce next week's offerings

**Adjust for Next Market:**
- Increase production of bestsellers
- Drop or modify slow-sellers
- Order more supplies of what sold out
- Refine pricing if needed

## Using Technology to Succeed {#technology-tools}

Modern farmers market vendors use technology to reduce waste, increase sales, and save time.

### Pre-Orders: Game-Changer for New Vendors

**What Pre-Orders Solve:**
- **Waste:** Produce exactly what's ordered (no guessing)
- **Cash flow:** Get paid before production
- **Planning:** Know what to make, how much
- **Market day:** Pre-packed orders = faster checkout

**Pre-Order Options:**

**1. Manual (Spreadsheet/DMs):**
- **Pros:** Free, simple to start
- **Cons:** Time-consuming, error-prone, 30-40% no-show rate
- **Best for:** Testing concept with <10 orders/week

**2. farmersmarketing.app Platform:**
- **Pros:** Automated order management, integrated payments, <5% no-show rate (pre-payment), pickup confirmation system, multi-market support
- **Cons:** 6.5% platform fee
- **Best for:** Serious vendors wanting growth

**3. Instagram/Facebook:**
- **Pros:** Free, uses existing platform
- **Cons:** Disorganized, hard to track payments, manual communication
- **Best for:** Very small scale only

**Pre-Order Best Practices:**
- Close orders 48 hours before market (gives production time)
- Require pre-payment (reduces no-shows from 30% to <5%)
- Send confirmation email immediately
- Send reminder 24 hours before market
- Organize pickup efficiently (alphabetical, time windows)

### Flash Sales for Market-Day Boost

Flash sales create urgency and drive foot traffic during market hours.

**Example Flash Sales:**
- "First 10 customers: Sourdough $6 (regular $8)"
- "Today only: 3 jars jam $18 (regular $21)"
- "Last hour: All remaining baked goods 25% off"

**farmersmarketing.app Flash Sale Features:**
- Geofenced notifications (alerts customers within 25 miles)
- Time-limited countdown
- Quantity limits
- Real-time inventory updates

**Results:** Vendors typically see 40-60% revenue increase on flash sale days.

### Payment Processing Technology

**Accept Cards (70% of transactions now card-based):**
- Square: 2.6% + $0.10 per swipe (most popular)
- Stripe: Similar rates
- farmersmarketing.app: Integrated payments (included in platform fee)

**Why Cards Matter:**
- Customers spend 30-40% more with cards vs cash
- Convenience = more sales
- Professional appearance

**Backup Plan:**
- Always have cash option available
- Bring change
- Card reader fails sometimes

### Social Media for Customer Connection

- Customer testimonials
- Farm/ingredient source stories

**When to Post:**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid {#common-mistakes}

Learn from others' mistakes instead of making them yourself.

### Mistake #1: Underpricing Products

**The mistake:** "I'll charge $4 to attract customers and raise prices later"

**Why it fails:**
- Working for $5-$10 per hour
- Can't sustain business long-term
- Customers resist price increases
- Devalues all vendors

**The fix:** Price for 50% profit margin from day one. Customers expect premium prices at farmers markets.

### Mistake #2: Not Using Pre-Orders

**The mistake:** "I'll just bring what I think will sell"

**Why it fails:**
- 30-50% waste from unsold products
- Constant stress about overproduction/underproduction
- Lost revenue from customers who wanted items that sold out

**The fix:** Implement pre-orders early. Even simple email-based pre-orders help.

### Mistake #3: Poor Booth Presentation

**The mistake:** Products in plastic storage bins, wrinkled tablecloth, handwritten prices on torn paper

**Why it fails:**
- Customers judge quality by presentation
- Looks unprofessional
- Doesn't inspire confidence

**The fix:** Invest in clean display materials. Price professionally. Take pride in booth appearance.

### Mistake #4: Being Passive at Booth

**The mistake:** Sitting behind table on phone, waiting for customers to approach

**Why it fails:**
- Customers feel uncomfortable interrupting
- Misses opportunity to connect
- Looks disengaged and uninterested

**The fix:** Stand, make eye contact, greet every customer warmly. Engagement drives sales.

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Customer Feedback

**The mistake:** "I know what customers want - my recipe is perfect"

**Why it fails:**
- Customers tell you what they want
- Ignoring feedback means lost sales
- Market demand beats your preferences

**The fix:** Listen, adapt, improve. Ask "What would you like to see next week?"

### Mistake #6: Trying to Sell Everything

**The mistake:** 20 different products the first week

**Why it fails:**
- Quality suffers
- Production overwhelming
- Can't be expert at everything
- Confuses customers

**The fix:** Start with 3-5 core products. Master those. Add gradually.

### Mistake #7: Not Collecting Customer Info

**The mistake:** Customers buy once and you have no way to contact them

**Why it fails:**
- Can't announce new products
- Can't promote pre-orders
- Start from zero every single week

**The fix:** Email signup sheet, QR code to farmersmarketing.app store, business cards with contact info.

### Mistake #8: Quitting Too Soon

**The mistake:** "I only made $200 my first market, this isn't working"

**Why it fails:**
- First market is learning experience
- Takes 4-8 weeks to build customer base
- Revenue grows as reputation builds

**The fix:** Commit to full season (12-16 weeks minimum). Evaluate then.

## Next Steps After Your First Market {#next-steps}

Your first market is complete. Now what?

### Week 1-4: Refine and Learn

**Focus areas:**
- Consistent quality production
- Customer feedback implementation
- Pricing validation (selling out = prices too low, excess inventory = prices might be high)
- Booth setup refinement

**Metrics to track:**
- Gross revenue per market
- Units sold per product
- Customer email signups
- Repeat customer rate

**Don't change too much too fast** - give products and pricing 3-4 weeks to stabilize before major adjustments.

### Week 5-8: Optimize Operations

**Add efficiency:**
- Implement pre-orders (farmersmarketing.app or basic system)
- Streamline production (batch processing)
- Improve booth setup time (practice = faster)

**Consider second market:**
- Different day of week
- Different demographic
- Test demand in new area

**Build customer relationships:**
- Remember regular customers' names
- Offer standing orders for repeat buyers
- Create email newsletter with weekly menu

### Week 9-12: Evaluate and Decide

**Questions to answer:**
- Are you profitable at 50%+ margin?
- Do you enjoy the work?
- Is demand growing?
- Are you reaching income goals?

**Three paths forward:**

**Path 1: Stay Part-Time**
- 1-2 markets per week
- Side income, not primary
- Balance with other work
- **Revenue potential:** $1,500-$4,000/month

**Path 2: Scale to Full-Time**
- Add markets (up to 4-6 per week)
- Hire help for production
- Invest in better equipment
- **Revenue potential:** $6,000-$15,000/month

**Path 3: Exit Gracefully**
- Not profitable or enjoyable
- Better opportunities elsewhere
- That's OK - you tried!
- Sell equipment, thank customers, move on

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I really need insurance to sell at farmers markets?**

A: Yes, 90% of established farmers markets require proof of general liability insurance (typically $1 million coverage). This protects you if someone claims illness from your product or is injured at your booth. Cost is $300-$800 per year. It's not optional - markets won't let you sell without it.

**Q: Can I sell products I didn't make myself?**

A: Most farmers markets require that you produce what you sell. Some markets allow co-packing (you provide recipe, licensed facility produces it), but you can't just buy wholesale products and resell them. Check your specific market's producer-only requirements.

**Q: What if it rains on market day?**

A: Most markets operate rain or shine. You're still required to attend and pay fees. Have a solid tent with weights, waterproof tablecloths, and plastic bins to protect products. Some markets cancel for severe weather, but this is rare.

**Q: How much money can I realistically make?**

A: Part-time vendors (1 market per week) typically earn $300-$1,000 per market day, or $15,000-$50,000 annually. Full-time vendors (4-6 markets per week) can earn $75,000-$150,000 annually gross revenue. Your profit margin (typically 40-60%) determines how much you actually keep after costs.

**Q: Do I need a commercial kitchen?**

A: Not if you're operating under cottage food laws (most small-scale vendors). Cottage food allows you to use your home kitchen for approved low-risk foods. You only need commercial kitchen access if you exceed cottage food revenue limits ($25,000-$125,000 depending on state) or want to make prohibited items like refrigerated foods.

**Q: Should I offer samples?**

A: Yes, if your product lends itself to sampling (baked goods, jams, dips, etc.). Samples significantly increase sales. Make sure you follow proper food safety practices when offering samples - use clean utensils, proper serving containers, and hand sanitizer. Some markets have specific sampling rules.

**Q: How do I handle customers who want to negotiate prices?**

A: Politely but firmly decline. "I appreciate your interest, but my prices are set to ensure quality ingredients and fair compensation for my work." Farmers market customers generally don't expect haggling - those who try are rare. Stand firm on your prices.

**Q: What's the best way to stand out from competitors?**

A: Three approaches: (1) Unique flavors or varieties nobody else offers, (2) Superior quality and presentation that justify premium pricing, (3) Strong personal story and customer connection. Combination of all three is ideal. Don't compete on price - compete on value.

**Q: Can I sell at multiple markets in one day?**

A: Possibly, if markets don't overlap in time. Some vendors do Saturday morning market (8 AM-12 PM) and Saturday afternoon market (3-7 PM). This requires excellent logistics and enough product for both. Many markets have exclusivity requirements preventing this - check market policies first.

**Q: What if I don't have enough product to fill a full season?**

A: Start with trial markets or day passes instead of committing to full season. Many markets offer single-day vendor spots for higher per-day fees. This lets you test without seasonal commitment. Build production capacity before committing to weekly attendance.
