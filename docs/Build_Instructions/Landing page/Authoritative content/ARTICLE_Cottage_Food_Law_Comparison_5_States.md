## Common Questions Across States

**Q: Can I sell at farmers markets in multiple states?**

A: You must comply with cottage food laws in the state where you produce AND where you sell. If you live in Texas but want to sell at markets in Oklahoma, you need to understand Oklahoma's laws too. Most vendors find it easier to stick to their home state initially.

**Q: What if I exceed my state's revenue limit?**

A: You must either:
- Stop production for the remainder of the year
- Transition to commercial kitchen and obtain proper licenses
- Move to a state with higher limits (if relocating anyway)

Revenue limits are firm - exceeding them makes you ineligible for cottage food exemption.

**Q: Can I make products in one state and ship to another?**

A: Generally no. Most states prohibit out-of-state shipping for cottage food. California and New York allow in-state shipping only. Texas and North Carolina don't allow shipping at all.

**Q: What happens if I get caught operating without proper registration?**

A: Consequences vary by state but typically include:
- Cease and desist order (immediate shutdown)
- Fines ($500-$5,000+ depending on state and violations)
- Confiscation of products and equipment
- Prohibition from future cottage food operation
- Potential criminal charges for repeat violations

Always register where required. The cost is minimal compared to penalty risk.

**Q: Can I hire employees for cottage food production?**

A: No, in all 5 states. Cottage food laws only allow:
- You (the registered operator)
- Members of your household

Once you need employees, you must transition to commercial kitchen and proper licensing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which state should I choose if I'm relocating specifically for cottage food business?**

A: Consider your priorities:
- **Revenue potential:** New York or Florida
- **Product flexibility:** California
- **Lowest cost to start:** Texas
- **Online sales:** California or New York
- **Simplest regulations:** Texas

Most vendors find Texas or California offer the best balance of flexibility and opportunity.

**Q: Can I operate under cottage food laws in two states simultaneously?**

A: Only if you maintain a primary residence in both states and comply with each state's rules independently. Most vendors find this impractical. Better to choose one state as home base.

**Q: How do states enforce cottage food laws?**

A: Enforcement varies:
- Consumer complaints (most common trigger)
- Random checks at farmers markets
- Health department investigations
- Follow-up on registration violations

Best practice: Comply fully from day one to avoid issues.

**Q: What if I want to exceed cottage food limits but can't afford commercial kitchen?**

A: Options:
- Rent commercial kitchen time ($15-$40/hour)
- Share kitchen space with other food businesses
- Kitchen incubators or co-packing facilities
- Apply for small business loans for kitchen build-out

Don't operate above cottage food limits without proper licensing - penalties are severe.
