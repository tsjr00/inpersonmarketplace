## 6-8 Weeks Before First Market {#weeks-6-8}

### Step 1: Research State Legal Requirements

**What you're doing:** Understanding exactly what's required in your state to sell food legally.

**How to do it:**
1. Visit our [Cottage Food Laws Database](/resources/legal/cottage-food-laws)
2. Find your state's specific page
3. Read the complete requirements (revenue limits, allowed products, labeling)
4. Print or save the requirements document
5. Note any required certifications or training
6. Bookmark official state health department resources

**Why it matters:** Legal violations can shut down your business and result in fines. Get this right from the start.

**Time:** 2-3 hours for thorough research

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** My state's cottage food law is confusing or unclear
- **Solution:** Call your state health department directly, or contact your county extension office (AgriLife Extension in Texas) for clarification

- **Problem:** My product isn't clearly listed as allowed or prohibited
- **Solution:** Email state health department with specific question. Get written confirmation before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Perfect Your Recipes and Products

**What you're doing:** Testing and refining recipes until they're consistently excellent.

**How to do it:**
1. Make your product at least 5 times (not just once!)
2. Test at the scale you'll produce for markets (batch size matters)
3. Give samples to honest friends/family (not just people who'll be nice)
4. Note any variations in results (oven temperature, humidity, etc.)
5. Document your final recipe precisely (measurements, timing, temp)
6. Calculate exact costs per unit (ingredients, packaging, labor)
7. Verify shelf life and storage requirements

**Why it matters:** Inconsistent quality kills repeat customers. Master your product before selling it.

**Time:** 3-4 weeks (spread out with multiple test batches)

**Testing checklist:**
- [ ] Product tastes/looks identical every time
- [ ] You can produce it at market-day volume (not just 1 batch)
- [ ] Shelf life meets market day + customer use needs
- [ ] Packaging keeps product fresh and protected
- [ ] Final cost allows for 50%+ profit margin
- [ ] Friends/family give honest positive feedback

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Recipe works at small scale but fails at larger batches
- **Solution:** This is normal. Adjust oven temp, baking time, or batch size. Commercial bakers often work in smaller batches than you'd think.

- **Problem:** Product is great on Monday but not as good by Saturday market
- **Solution:** Adjust production schedule (bake Friday night instead of Monday), change packaging, or reformulate for longer shelf life.

---

### Step 3: Register Your Business Name (If Needed)

**What you're doing:** Officially registering your business name if you're using one other than your personal name.

**How to do it:**
1. Choose your business name (check availability first)
2. Search county clerk's website for existing DBAs (avoid duplicates)
3. Visit county clerk's office or file online
4. Pay filing fee ($25-$100 typical)
5. Receive DBA certificate (usually same day or within 1 week)
6. Keep certificate safe (needed for market applications, bank accounts)

**Why it matters:** Using a business name without registration can result in fines. Many markets require proof of DBA.

**Time:** 2-3 hours (including travel to county clerk if required)

**When to skip this step:** If you're selling under your personal name (like "Jane Smith's Jams"), you don't need a DBA.

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** My desired business name is already taken
- **Solution:** Add geographic identifier ("Hill Country Honey" instead of just "Honey"), or choose a variant. Check availability before falling in love with a name.

---

### Step 4: Obtain Sales Tax Permit

**What you're doing:** Registering with your state to collect and remit sales tax.

**How to do it:**
1. Visit your state comptroller or revenue department website
2. Look for "Sales Tax Permit" or "Seller's Permit" application
3. Complete online application (usually free)
4. Provide: Business name, address, estimated sales, product type
5. Receive permit number (usually instant or within 1-2 weeks)
6. Print permit for your records
7. Understand filing frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annually)

**Why it matters:** Required by law. Markets often ask for permit number on application.

**Time:** 30-60 minutes for application

**Cost:** Usually free in most states

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Not sure how much sales to estimate
- **Solution:** Estimate conservatively. This doesn't lock you in - you can exceed estimates without penalty.

- **Problem:** Website asks for industry code (NAICS)
- **Solution:** Most cottage food vendors use code 722320 (Caterers) or 311999 (All Other Miscellaneous Food Manufacturing). Choose closest match.

---

### Step 5: Get Food Handler Certification (If Required)

**What you're doing:** Completing required food safety training.

**How to do it:**
1. Check if your state or target markets require certification
2. Choose approved online course (ServSafe, StateFoodSafety, or state-specific)
3. Complete 2-3 hour online training
4. Pass exam (usually 70% or higher)
5. Print certificate immediately
6. Note expiration date (typically 2-5 years)

**Why it matters:** Required by many markets. Demonstrates food safety knowledge. Protects you and customers.

**Time:** 2-3 hours total

**Cost:** $7-$30 depending on provider

**Recommended providers:**
- Texas: Texas A&M AgriLife Extension ($7)
- National: ServSafe ($15)
- National: StateFoodSafety ($10-15)

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Failed the exam
- **Solution:** Retake immediately (most providers allow multiple attempts). Review questions you missed. Common areas: temperature danger zone (41°F-135°F), cross-contamination, handwashing.

---

### Step 6: Purchase Liability Insurance

**What you're doing:** Obtaining general liability insurance coverage.

**How to do it:**
1. Research providers specializing in farmers market/cottage food vendors
2. Request quotes from 2-3 providers (comparison shopping)
3. Provide information: Product type, estimated annual sales, market locations
4. Choose policy with minimum $1 million coverage (required by most markets)
5. Purchase annual policy
6. Receive certificate of insurance (usually emailed within 24-48 hours)
7. Keep multiple copies (digital and printed)

**Why it matters:** Required by 90% of established markets. Protects you from lawsuits if customer claims injury or illness.

**Time:** 2-4 hours for research and application

**Cost:** $300-$800 per year (typically $400-$500)

**Recommended providers:**
- ACT Insurance (cottage food specialist)
- Farmer's Market Legal
- RLI Corp
- Philadelphia Insurance Companies
- State Farm or Nationwide (general business policies)

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Insurance seems expensive
- **Solution:** It's a necessary business cost. Budget $400 annually. One lawsuit without insurance could bankrupt you - $400 is cheap protection.

- **Problem:** Provider unfamiliar with cottage food laws
- **Solution:** Use specialist like ACT Insurance or Farmer's Market Legal. They understand cottage food operations and offer appropriate coverage.

## 4-6 Weeks Before First Market {#weeks-4-6}

### Step 7: Research and Select Target Markets

**What you're doing:** Choosing which farmers markets to apply to based on fit and profitability potential.

**How to do it:**
1. List all markets within reasonable distance (30-45 minute drive)
2. For each market, research:
   - Days and hours of operation
   - Vendor fees (per day or seasonal)
   - Vendor mix (how many competitors in your category?)
   - Customer demographics (affluent vs working-class)
   - Market policies and requirements
3. Visit each potential market as customer (at least once)
4. Observe: Customer traffic, vendor success, market atmosphere
5. Talk to existing vendors (ask about their experience)
6. Rank markets by priority (best fit to worst fit)

**Why it matters:** Not all markets are equal. Choosing the right market significantly impacts your success.

**Time:** 3-5 hours per market (includes visit + research)

**Evaluation criteria:**
- [ ] Reasonable vendor fees ($15-$50 per day)
- [ ] Steady customer traffic (not dead or overcrowded)
- [ ] 0-2 direct competitors (not 5+ jam vendors)
- [ ] Customers buying premium products (not bargain hunting)
- [ ] Professional market management
- [ ] Accessible location with parking
- [ ] Schedule fits your availability

**Use our [Market Comparison Tool](/resources/calculators/market-comparison) to evaluate options systematically.**

### Step 8: Apply to Farmers Markets

**What you're doing:** Submitting vendor applications to your selected markets.

**How to do it:**
1. Download application from market website or request from market manager
2. Gather required documents:
   - DBA certificate (if applicable)
   - Sales tax permit
   - Liability insurance certificate
   - Food handler certification
   - Product photos (high-quality, well-lit)
   - Booth setup photos (if you have them) or sketch
3. Complete application thoroughly (no blank fields)
4. Write compelling product description (why you're unique)
5. Pay application fee ($25-$50 typical)
6. Submit application by deadline (often 4-8 weeks before season starts)
7. Follow up in 1-2 weeks if no response

**Why it matters:** Popular markets fill up. Early, complete applications get priority.

**Time:** 1-2 hours per market application

**Application tips:**
- Be specific about products (not just "baked goods" - list specific items)
- Explain what makes you different (unique flavors, local ingredients, family recipe)
- Professional photos make huge difference
- Apply to 2-3 markets to increase chances of acceptance
- If wait-listed, stay in contact - vendors drop out regularly

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Application rejected
- **Solution:** Ask for feedback. Often it's too many vendors in your category. Ask about waitlist. Apply to smaller/newer markets. Improve product differentiation and reapply next season.

---

### Step 9: Purchase Essential Equipment

**What you're doing:** Buying booth setup equipment and display materials.

**How to do it:**
1. Reference our complete [Equipment Guide](/resources/getting-started/equipment-guide)
2. Purchase in this order (prioritize essentials):

**Priority 1 (Must-Have):**
- [ ] 10x10 pop-up canopy tent ($150-$400)
- [ ] Tent weights (40 lbs per leg = 160 lbs total) ($30-$80)
- [ ] Two 6-foot folding tables ($80-$120 total)
- [ ] Tablecloths (2-3) ($30-$60)
- [ ] Cash box with lock ($20-$40)
- [ ] Starting change ($100-$150 in small bills)

**Priority 2 (Highly Recommended):**
- [ ] Payment card reader (Square or similar) ($0 upfront, 2.6% + 10¢ per transaction)
- [ ] Display risers or crates (3-5 pieces) ($30-$75)
- [ ] Business signage (business name, readable from 20 feet) ($30-$80)
- [ ] Price signs (professional, clear) ($20-$40)
- [ ] Business cards (500 cards) ($20-$50)

**Priority 3 (Nice-to-Have):**
- [ ] Hand truck or wagon (for hauling) ($40-$100)
- [ ] Coolers (if needed for product) ($30-$80)
- [ ] Portable fan (for hot days) ($20-$40)
- [ ] Extra tablecloths and supplies (backup) ($30-$50)

3. Test all equipment at home (practice setup/breakdown)
4. Make list of anything missing or needed

**Why it matters:** Professional equipment = professional appearance = customer trust = more sales.

**Time:** 4-6 hours for shopping (spread across multiple trips)

**Total cost:** $500-$900 for solid essential setup

**Money-saving tips:**
- Buy used tent (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist) - can save $100+
- Borrow tables initially from friends/family
- DIY signage (foam board + nice lettering)
- Build wooden crates yourself ($10 materials vs $15-$20 to buy)

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Overwhelming options and decisions
- **Solution:** Start with absolute essentials (tent, tables, weights, cash box). Add display pieces gradually as budget allows.

---

### Step 10: Create Product Labels

**What you're doing:** Designing and printing labels that meet legal requirements.

**How to do it:**
1. Review your state's specific labeling requirements
2. Create label design including:
   - Product name
   - Ingredient list (descending order by weight)
   - Allergen warnings (milk, eggs, wheat, soy, nuts, fish, shellfish)
   - Net weight or volume
   - Your business name and address
   - Cottage food disclaimer (state-specific wording)
3. Choose label format:
   - Print at home (Avery labels, $0.05-$0.15 each)
   - Professional printing (Sticker Mule, UPrinting, $0.25-$0.50 each)
4. Print test batch (verify readability, adhesion)
5. Order sufficient quantity for first market + extras

**Why it matters:** Legal requirement. Non-compliant labels risk fines and shutdown.

**Time:** 3-5 hours for design, testing, ordering

**Cost:** $20-$100 depending on volume and method

**Texas disclaimer example:**
"This food is made in a home kitchen and is not inspected by the Department of State Health Services or a local health department."

**Label design tips:**
- Keep it simple and readable (avoid tiny fonts)
- Include logo or brand element
- Use high-quality paper/stickers (won't smear or peel)
- Test on your packaging (does it stick? stay stuck?)

**Resources:**
- Canva (free design tool with templates)
- Avery Design & Print (for home printing)
- Sticker Mule (custom labels, minimum orders)

### Step 11: Set Up Payment Processing

**What you're doing:** Enabling card payments (70% of customers now pay by card).

**How to do it:**

**Option A: Mobile Card Reader (Square/Stripe)**
1. Download Square or Stripe app
2. Create business account (free)
3. Order free card reader (ships in 3-5 days)
4. Connect to bank account (for deposits)
5. Test transaction (practice with friend)
6. Understand fees (2.6% + $0.10 per swipe for Square)

**Option B: Integrated Platform (farmersmarketing.app)**
1. Sign up at farmersmarketing.app
2. Connect Stripe account during setup
3. Payments integrated with pre-orders automatically
4. Fees included in platform fee (6.5% + $0.15)

**Why it matters:** Customers spend 30-40% more when paying by card. Missing card payments = missing sales.

**Time:** 30-60 minutes for setup

**Cost:** No upfront cost, pay per transaction (2.6-6.5% typical)

**Backup plan:** Always accept cash. Bring change. Card readers sometimes fail.

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Card reader not connecting to phone
- **Solution:** Ensure Bluetooth enabled, reader charged, app updated. Restart phone if needed. Have cash backup plan.

---

### Step 12: Set Up farmersmarketing.app Account (Recommended)

**What you're doing:** Creating your vendor profile on farmersmarketing.app for pre-orders and market management.

**How to do it:**
1. Visit farmersmarketing.app/signup
2. Create vendor account (basic info: name, email, phone)
3. Complete vendor profile:
   - Business name and description
   - Profile photo or logo
   - Products you'll sell
   - Market locations and dates
4. Add product listings:
   - Product name and description
   - Clear photos (well-lit, appetizing)
   - Price
   - Available quantity
   - Pickup locations (markets or private pickup)
5. Set pre-order deadline (typically 48 hours before market)
6. Test platform (place practice order, cancel it)
7. Share your store link (save to phone, print QR code)

**Why it matters:** Pre-orders reduce waste by 30-50%, increase revenue 20-40%, and make market day smoother.

**Time:** 45-60 minutes for complete setup

**Cost:** Free to set up, 6.5% + $0.15 per order (paid by buyer)

**Benefits over Instagram DMs or spreadsheets:**
- Automated payment processing (no chasing Venmo)
- Pickup confirmation system (reduces no-shows from 30% to <5%)
- Multi-market management (one platform for all your markets)
- Customer database (automatic email collection)
- Flash sales capability (geofenced notifications)

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Not sure what to charge or how to describe products
- **Solution:** Look at competitors' pricing, write descriptions focusing on what makes yours special (ingredients, process, story). You can always edit later.

---

### Step 13: Create Marketing Materials

**What you're doing:** Designing business cards, social media presence, and customer communication.

**How to do it:**

**Business Cards:**
1. Design simple card with:
   - Business name
   - Product description (one line)
   - Contact: Email, phone, Instagram
   - QR code to farmersmarketing.app store (optional but recommended)
2. Order 500 cards (VistaPrint, Moo, local printer)
3. Cost: $20-$50 for 500

**Social Media Setup:**
1. Create Instagram account (primary for food businesses)
2. Post 3-5 photos before first market:
   - Product photos
   - Behind-scenes production
   - Your story/introduction
3. Create Facebook business page (secondary)
4. Post weekly market schedule and location

**Email List Setup:**
1. Create simple signup sheet (paper or digital tablet)
2. Offer incentive: "Join our email list for first access to pre-orders"
3. Prepare first welcome email (introduce yourself, explain pre-orders)

**QR Code for farmersmarketing.app:**
1. Generate QR code linking to your store
2. Print on business cards and booth signage
3. Customers scan = instant access to pre-order

**Why it matters:** Customers can't buy if they can't find you. Marketing materials enable repeat business.

**Time:** 3-5 hours total for design and ordering

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Not comfortable with social media
- **Solution:** Start simple. Post 1-2 times per week. Focus on product photos. Authenticity beats perfection. Or skip social entirely and focus on email list + farmersmarketing.app.

## 1 Week Before First Market {#week-1}

### Step 14: Practice Market Day Production

**What you're doing:** Producing a full market's worth of inventory to test timing and capacity.

**How to do it:**
1. Calculate how many units to bring (start conservative: 25-40 units)
2. Create production schedule:
   - When to shop for ingredients
   - When to produce (allow 2-3 days before market for baked goods)
   - When to package and label
3. Execute full production run as if for real market
4. Time yourself at each stage
5. Note bottlenecks or problems
6. Pack products for transport (verify packaging works)
7. Store properly (temperature, protection)

**Why it matters:** First production run always reveals problems. Better to discover issues during practice than day-before-market panic.

**Time:** Full production day (8-12 hours typical)

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Production took way longer than expected
- **Solution:** This is normal for first run. You'll get faster with practice. Start earlier next time, or reduce quantity for first real market.

- **Problem:** Ran out of ingredient mid-batch
- **Solution:** Always buy 10-15% extra ingredients to account for spills, mistakes, testing. Create shopping list with built-in buffer.

---

### Step 15: Plan Market Day Logistics

**What you're doing:** Creating detailed plan for market day setup, operation, and breakdown.

**How to do it:**
1. Know your market details:
   - Date and time
   - Arrival time (typically 1-2 hours before market opens)
   - Exact location and booth assignment
   - Parking and unload zone
2. Create packing list (use checklist below)
3. Load vehicle strategically (last in = first out)
4. Plan arrival timeline:
   - Drive time + buffer
   - Unload (15-20 minutes)
   - Tent setup (10-15 minutes)
   - Table and display setup (30-40 minutes)
   - Final prep (15-20 minutes)
5. Plan what to wear (weather-appropriate, comfortable)
6. Prepare cash box with starting change
7. Charge phone and card reader

**Market Day Packing Checklist:**

**Structure & Display:**

- [ ] QR code displayed for customers to place future orders

**Why it matters:** Forgetting something critical = stressful market day. Checklist prevents this.

---

### Step 16: Prepare Your "Elevator Pitch"

**What you're doing:** Crafting 30-second introduction to your business that connects with customers.

**How to do it:**
1. Write out answers to these questions:
   - Who are you?
   - What do you make?
   - What makes it special/different?
   - Why should customers buy from you?
2. Combine into 30-second story
3. Practice saying it naturally (not memorized/robotic)
4. Get feedback from friends/family
5. Refine until it flows smoothly

**Example template:**
"Hi! I'm [Name], and I make [product] using [what makes it special]. I started this because [brief why - family recipe, local ingredients, personal passion]. My customers love [bestseller/unique feature]. Would you like to try a sample?"

**Real example:**
"Hi! I'm Emma, and I make small-batch sourdough bread using a 100-year-old starter from my great-grandmother's Texas farm. Everything is naturally leavened and hand-shaped - no commercial yeast or preservatives. My rosemary olive is the bestseller. Would you like to try a sample?"

**Why it matters:** Customers buy from people they connect with. Your story matters.

**Time:** 30-60 minutes to craft and practice

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Feels awkward or forced
- **Solution:** Practice until it's conversational. Don't memorize word-for-word. Just know the key points. Authenticity > polish.

---

## Day Before First Market {#day-before}

### Step 17: Final Production Run

**What you're doing:** Producing all inventory for market day.

**How to do it:**
1. Shop for any last-minute ingredients
2. Follow your tested production schedule
3. Start early (things take longer than expected)
4. Package products immediately after cooling/completion
5. Label everything (don't leave for morning!)
6. Store properly (protect from heat, cold, humidity)
7. Count final inventory (know exactly what you have)

**Why it matters:** Fresh products sell better. Rushing morning-of leads to mistakes.

**Time:** 8-14 hours depending on product type and volume

**Production tips:**
- Start 2-3 days early for baked goods (many are better day-after)
- Don't make more than you can realistically sell (start conservative)
- Keep 2-3 units aside for samples
- Build in buffer for mistakes (make 32 if you need 30)

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Something burned/didn't turn out
- **Solution:** This is why you made extras. If you don't have enough, adjust expectations for first market (it's okay to have limited quantity). Or make emergency 6 AM batch if truly necessary.

---

### Step 18: Load Vehicle and Final Prep

**What you're doing:** Strategic packing to make market setup smooth.

**How to do it:**
1. Reference your packing checklist (Step 15)
2. Pack vehicle in reverse order (first out = last in):
   - Products last (easiest to grab)
   - Tent first (needs to come out first at market)
   - Tables and displays in middle
3. Secure items (nothing rolling around during drive)
4. Do final check against checklist
5. Prepare cash box with change ($100-$150 in small bills)
6. Charge phone and card reader fully
7. Set multiple alarms (don't oversleep!)
8. Layout clothes for morning (minimize AM decisions)
9. Get good sleep (you'll need energy!)

**Why it matters:** Smooth setup = less stress = better first impression.

**Common problems:**
- **Problem:** Tent doesn't fit in vehicle with everything else
- **Solution:** Put tent weights in separate container, collapse tables completely, use roof rack if available. Practice packing before market day.

## Market Day: Your First Sale {#market-day}

### Step 19: Setup Your Booth

**What you're doing:** Setting up professional, inviting booth before market opens.

**How to do it:**

**2 hours before market opens:**
1. Arrive at market location
2. Find your assigned booth space
3. Introduce yourself to market manager (check in)
4. Unload essentials (tent, weights, tables) - minimize trips
5. Set up tent FIRST
6. IMMEDIATELY weight all four legs (40 lbs each minimum)
7. Set up tables under tent
8. Add tablecloths

**1.5 hours before:**
1. Arrange display (reference photo of ideal setup)
2. Use risers for visual interest (different heights)
3. Place products thoughtfully (bestsellers prominent)
4. Ensure prices clearly visible
5. Add signage (business name, descriptions)

**1 hour before:**
1. Set out business cards
2. Display farmersmarketing.app QR code
3. Position email signup sheet
4. Prepare samples (if offering)
5. Organize cash box and card reader
6. Final visual check (step back 15 feet, see customer view)

**30 minutes before:**
1. Use restroom (won't have chance during market)
2. Eat/drink if needed
3. Meet neighboring vendors (introduce yourself)
4. Review your elevator pitch mentally
5. Take deep breath - you're ready!

**Market Opens:**
1. Stand (don't sit) - appear engaged
2. Smile and make eye contact
3. Greet every customer warmly
4. Be present (not on phone)

**Why it matters:** First impression is everything. Professional setup = customer confidence = sales.

**Time:** 1.5-2 hours for full setup

---

### Step 20: Engage Customers and Make Sales

**What you're doing:** Connecting with customers, telling your story, and completing transactions.

**Customer interaction tips:**

**Greeting:**
- "Good morning! Welcome to [Your Business Name]!"
- Make eye contact and smile
- Let them browse briefly before engaging

**Telling Your Story:**
- Use your practiced elevator pitch naturally
- Focus on what makes you different
- Mention local ingredients, family recipes, artisan methods

**Offering Samples:**
- "Would you like to try a sample?"
- Have samples ready with small plates/napkins
- Engage while they're tasting ("This is our rosemary olive - the rosemary is from a local farm")

**Answering Questions:**
- Know your ingredients (allergens especially)
- Explain your process if asked
- Be honest about shelf life
- Suggest pairings or uses

**Handling Objections:**
- **"Too expensive":** Don't apologize. "I use premium ingredients and everything is made by hand in small batches. The quality really shows - would you like to try a sample?"
- **"Just looking":** "Take your time! I'm right here if you have questions."
- **"I'll come back later":** "Great! I'm here until [closing time]. By the way, here's my card in case you'd like to pre-order for next week."

**Making the Sale:**
- When customer decides: "Perfect! That'll be $8. Cash or card?"
- Count change clearly (build trust)
- Bag purchase carefully (product protection)
- Hand over with smile: "Thank you! Enjoy, and I'll see you next week!"
- Give business card: "Here's my card - you can pre-order online for next week"

**Slow Periods:**
- Remain standing and engaged (don't sit on phone)
- Straighten display
- Chat with neighboring vendors
- Observe what's working at other booths

**If You Sell Out:**
- AMAZING! Note what sold out first
- Take pre-orders for next week using farmersmarketing.app
- Don't leave early (stay until official close per market rules)
- Use time to network with other vendors

**Why it matters:** Customer connection drives sales. Be present, authentic, and helpful.

### Step 21: Track Sales and Customer Information

**What you're doing:** Recording data to evaluate success and follow up with customers.

**During market:**
- Keep running tally of what sells (mental note or quick marks)
- Collect emails (signup sheet or farmersmarketing.app automatic collection)
- Note customer feedback (what they liked, what they asked for)
- Observe patterns (what time is busiest, who your customers are)

**Post-market:**
1. Count all cash carefully
2. Separate from starting change
3. Total cash sales
4. Check card reader for card sales
5. Add cash + card = gross revenue
6. Calculate units sold by product type
7. Note any problems or surprises

**Why it matters:** Data drives improvement. Track now, optimize later.

### Step 22: Post-Market Evaluation and Follow-Up

**What you're doing:** Analyzing results and connecting with customers.

**Immediate (Within 2 hours of market close):**
1. Pack up systematically (products first, tent last)
2. Return home and store remaining products properly
3. Count money and record sales
4. Sit down with notebook and answer:
   - Total revenue?
   - What sold well (bestsellers)?
   - What didn't sell?
   - What did customers ask for that I didn't have?
   - What would I do differently next week?
   - Did I break even? Make profit? (Compare to expenses)

**Within 24 Hours:**
1. Thank customers via email (if collected addresses)
2. Post on social media:
   - Thank you to customers
   - Photo of your booth
   - Preview next week's offerings
   - Link to farmersmarketing.app for pre-orders
3. Process any pre-orders for next week

**Within 1 Week:**
1. Adjust production plan based on what sold
2. Order more supplies of bestsellers
3. Consider dropping items that didn't sell
4. Refine pricing if needed (selling out too fast = raise prices)
5. Improve booth display based on observations
6. Start planning for next market

**Why it matters:** Continuous improvement separates successful vendors from struggling ones. Evaluate, adjust, repeat.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I start selling in less than 6 weeks?**

A: Possible but not recommended. Insurance takes 1-2 weeks to process, market applications require 2-4 weeks notice, and you need time to perfect products. Rushing leads to mistakes. If you must rush, minimum 3-4 weeks with everything expedited.

**Q: What if I forget something on market day?**

A: Don't panic. Other vendors are incredibly helpful - ask to borrow what you forgot. Markets often have backup supplies. Make note for next time. Most "critical" forgotten items aren't actually critical.

**Q: How much inventory should I bring to my first market?**

A: Conservative estimate: 25-40 units total. Better to sell out (looks successful, creates urgency) than have excess waste. You can take pre-orders for next week if you sell out. Increase quantities gradually based on actual sales data.

**Q: What if nobody buys anything?**

A: Extremely unlikely if you've followed this checklist. But if sales are slow: Offer samples, engage customers warmly, refine your display, and stick with it. First markets are learning experiences. Some vendors take 3-4 weeks to build momentum.

**Q: Do I really need to do all of this?**

A: Yes, if you want to operate legally and professionally. Shortcuts (no insurance, no permits, improper labels) risk fines, shutdown, or lawsuits. The checklist protects you and sets foundation for success.
