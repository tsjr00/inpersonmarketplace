# Landing Page Content Edits - January 19, 2026

**For:** CC (Claude Code)
**From:** Tracy's testing review
**Page:** `/farmers_market` landing page

---

## 🎯 HERO SECTION

### Bullet Points Below Buttons

**Location:** Below "Browse Products" and "Find Markets" buttons

**Current:**
- Verified Vendors
- Secure Payments
- Local Pickup

**Change to (in this order):**
- Local Vendors
- Local Pickup
- Secure Payments

---

## 📊 TRUST BAR / STATS SECTION

### Supporting Text

**Location:** Below the Products/Vendors/Markets stats (tan shaded area)

**Current:**
"Supporting local farmers and artisans in your community"

**Change to:**
"Supporting local producers and artisans in your community"

**Reason:** Not just food, broader than farmers

---

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS SECTION

### Step 2: Shop and Order

**Current:**
"Add items to your cart from multiple vendors. Complete your order with secure checkout"

**Change to:**
"Choose your market. Add items to your cart. Complete your order with secure checkout (from one or more vendors)"

---

### Step 3: Schedule Pickup → Pick Up Fresh

**Current Title:** "Schedule Pickup"
**Change to:** "Pick Up Fresh"

**Current Text:**
"Choose your pickup day at the market. Vendors prepare your order fresh for collection"

**Change to:**
"Visit the market. Collect your pre-order items with guaranteed availability"

**Context:** This combines the reality that items are picked up from specific market on specific day when market is open. Uses verbiage from old Step 4.

---

### Step 4: New Step → Enjoy the Market

**New Title:** "Enjoy the Market"

**New Text (suggested):**
"Take your time browsing other vendors, meet friends, and enjoy being part of your local community"

**Alternative suggestion:**
"Explore the full market at your own pace. Connect with neighbors and discover new local producers"

**Context:** Reinforcing that people still go to market, still have fun, still meet friends. Not just transactional.

---

### Summary of New Flow:
1. Discover
2. Shop and Order
3. Pick Up Fresh
4. Enjoy the Market (NEW)

---

## 🟢 START SHOPPING BUTTON

**Location:** Big green circle below How It Works section

**Current Issue:**
- "Start" and "Shopping" are different sizes
- "Shopping" is bold, "Start" is not

**Fix:**
- Both words SAME size
- Both words SAME font
- Both words BOLD
- Keep stacked layout
- Can make both slightly bigger to fill circle better

---

## 🏪 DISCOVER MARKETS SECTION

**No changes - leave as is**

---

## 💡 WHY CHOOSE OUR PLATFORM SECTION

### Section Title

**Current:** "Why Choose Our Platform"

**Note:** Tracy not sure she loves this heading. Keep for now but consider alternatives.

### Subtitle

**Current:** "Built for buyers and vendors who value quality, convenience, and community"

**Change to:**
"Built for shoppers and vendors who value quality, convenience, and community"

---

### Card 1: Verified Vendors
**No changes - leave as is**

---

### Card 2: Mobile Friendly

**Current:**
"Browse, order, and manage pickups from any device. Our platform works seamlessly on phones, tablets, and desktops"

**Change to:**
"Browse, order, and manage pickups from any device. Our platform works on phones, tablets, and desktops. For the best experience, try landscape mode on mobile to see more at once"

**Alternative (more concise):**
"Shop from any device - mobile or desktop. Landscape mode on mobile shows more products at once for easier browsing"

**Context:** Remove "seamlessly", add note that landscape view is better on some screens because you can see more stuff.

---

### Card 3: Local Focus
**No changes - leave as is**

---

### Card 4: Order Updates
**No changes - leave as is**

---

### Card 5: Easy Returns → REPLACE ENTIRELY

**Current:** Easy Returns

**Remove this card completely.** Replace with new card focused on one of these themes:

**Option A - Guaranteed Availability:**
**Title:** "No Sold-Out Items"
**Text:** "Pre-order your favorites with guaranteed availability. Sleep in on market day and still get everything you want"

**Option B - Fresh Products:**
**Title:** "Farm-Fresh Quality"
**Text:** "Pre-order from local producers. Skip the early morning rush and still get the freshest products"

**Option C - Convenience:**
**Title:** "Skip the Rush"
**Text:** "Order ahead and pick up on your schedule. No more racing to the market before items sell out"

**Context:** Don't mention returns, refunds, or customer service. Platform doesn't handle those - it's between shopper and vendor. Focus on fresh, sleeping in, guaranteed availability, not sold out.

---

### Card 6: Support Local → REPLACE

**Current:** Support Local (too similar to "Local Focus")

**Replace with different theme. Suggested options:**

**Option A - Market Day Made Easy:**
**Title:** "Your Time, Your Way"
**Text:** "Pre-order and pick up on your schedule. Enjoy the market experience without the early morning rush"

**Option B - Never Miss Out:**
**Title:** "Never Miss Out"
**Text:** "Reserve your favorites before market day. Guaranteed availability means no more disappointment when items sell out"

**Context:** Don't repeat "local" theme. Focus on sleeping in, not sold out, enjoying your day, not rushing to market early.

---

### Layout Note:
Organize cards so one-line descriptions are next to one-line descriptions, and two-line descriptions are next to two-line descriptions. Don't mix - it throws spacing off.

---

## 👨‍🌾 GROW YOUR BUSINESS / VENDOR SECTION

### Remove Text Below Button

**Location:** Below "Become a Vendor" button

**Remove:** "Free to join, only pay when you sell"

**Reason:** Vendors will have expectation of fees, but don't advertise it to everyone. Let vendors discover pricing details later.

---

### Bullet Points - Revisions

**Keep as-is:**
- Pre-sell products before market day
- Manage orders and inventory in one place
- Accept credit cards and online payments (NOTE: See revision below)
- Build a loyal customer following
- Get discovered by new local shoppers

**Revise:**

**Current:** "Know exactly what to bring - reduce waste"
**Change to:** "Know exactly what to bring - less wasted effort hauling unsold products back"

**Alternative:**
"Bring only what you need - avoid hauling unsold inventory back home"

**Context:** Pain point is wasted energy and effort bringing too much, only selling a little, having to take it all back. Efficiency angle.

---

**Current:** "Accept credit cards and online payments"
**Change to:** "Credit card fees already built in"

**Context:** They can already accept cards elsewhere. Highlight that platform handles this, makes them wonder how.

---

**Current:** "Build a loyal customer following"
**Enhance to:** "Build a loyal customer following among your VIP shoppers"

**Context:** Teases the VIP program.

---

### Additional Bullets (Optional)

Can add 2-4 more bullets to reach 8-10 total (must be even number). Suggested additions:

- "Reduce no-shows with confirmed pre-orders"
- "Expand your customer base beyond market hours"
- "Track your best-selling products and customer preferences"
- "Offer exclusive items to your repeat customers"

---

### Layout Organization

**Important:** Organize bullets by theme and length:
- Similar features side-by-side or above/below each other
- One-line bullets next to one-line bullets
- Two-line bullets next to two-line bullets
- Group related value propositions together

**Example grouping:**
- Row 1: Pre-sell products | Know what to bring
- Row 2: Manage orders/inventory | Track best-sellers
- Row 3: Credit card fees built in | Build VIP following
- Row 4: Get discovered | Expand customer base

---

## 🚀 READY TO GET STARTED SECTION

### Main Text

**Current:**
"Join our growing community of local food lovers and support farmers in your neighborhood"

**Change to:**
"Join our growing community of local producers and artisans, and the neighbors who support them"

**Alternative:**
"Join our growing community connecting local producers, artisans, and the neighbors who support them"

**Context:** Not just food, broader scope. More inclusive language.

---
