# SECTION 1: FOR BUYERS

## Welcome to Farm-Direct Shopping

**You're about to discover a better way to buy fresh, local food.**

Skip the grocery store. Skip the crowds. Skip the uncertainty of "will they have what I want?"

With our platform, you browse local products from your phone, order what you want, and pick it up fresh at your neighborhood farmers market—guaranteed to be there, set aside just for you.

**This is how shopping for local food should work.**

---

## Your Shopping Journey (7 Steps)

### Step 1: Browse Local Products

**What you do:** Explore products from vendors at markets near you.

**What you'll see:**
- Farm-fresh produce, eggs, honey, baked goods, and more
- Photos and descriptions from real local producers
- Pickup locations and dates for each item
- Transparent pricing (what you see is what you pay)

**Why this matters:**  
You're seeing exactly what local farmers and artisans are bringing to your market this week. No surprises, no sold-out disappointments.

**Benefits to you:**
- Shop from your couch, not in a parking lot
- Compare options across multiple vendors
- Plan your market trip in advance

**Benefits to local food:**  
Your pre-orders help small producers plan their harvests and reduce food waste. They bring exactly what's ordered, nothing gets thrown away at day's end.

---

### Step 2: Add Items to Your Cart

**What you do:** Select items from one or more vendors. Add to cart.

**The rule:** Minimum $10 order (combined total across all vendors).

**Why this minimum exists:**  
Small orders cost us the same to process, but vendors receive very little after payment processing fees. The $10 minimum ensures farmers and artisans get fair compensation for their work.

**Benefits to you:**
- Encourages trying products from multiple vendors
- Discover variety you wouldn't find at a grocery store
- Build relationships with several local producers

**Benefits to local food:**  
When you support multiple vendors in one trip, you strengthen the entire local food ecosystem. Markets thrive when shoppers explore beyond just one favorite booth.

---

### Step 3: Secure Checkout

**What you do:** Complete payment with your credit card.

**What happens:**
- Payment is processed immediately (secure, encrypted)
- Order is sent to each vendor
- You receive confirmation email with order details
- Money is held safely until you pick up your items

**Why we hold payment:**  
This protects you. Vendors don't get paid until they hand you your items and you confirm you received them. If something goes wrong, you're covered.

**Pricing transparency:**
- Vendor sets base price (what they need to earn)
- Platform adds 6.5% + $0.15 service fee
- You see total price at checkout (no hidden fees)

**Benefits to you:**
- Your payment is protected
- No cash needed at the market
- Digital receipt for your records
- Guaranteed your items will be there

**Benefits to local food:**  
Pre-payment allows small producers to invest in growing and preparing your order with confidence. No financial risk for them means more farmers can participate.

---

### Step 4: Vendor Confirms Your Order

**What happens (within 24 hours):**
- Vendor reviews your order
- Confirms they can fulfill it
- Begins preparing your items

**You'll receive:** Email notification that your order is confirmed.

**Why this step exists:**  
Farmers work with nature—weather, crop yields, and livestock production aren't always predictable. This confirmation ensures the vendor can actually deliver what you ordered.

**Benefits to you:**
- No last-minute surprises
- Vendor has time to ask questions if needed
- You know your order is coming

**Benefits to local food:**  
This honest communication builds trust. Farmers aren't pressured to promise what they can't deliver. You get realistic expectations, not false hopes.

---

### Step 5: Items Marked Ready for Pickup

**What happens (before market day):**
- Vendor harvests, bakes, or prepares your items fresh
- Marks your order "Ready for Pickup" in the system
- Your items are labeled with your order number

**You'll receive:** Email and app notification that your order is ready.

**When to pick up:** Visit the market on the scheduled pickup day/time shown in your order.

**Benefits to you:**
- Items prepared fresh, not sitting in storage
- No guessing if your order is ready
- Vendor expects you (no awkward "do you have my order?" moments)

**Benefits to local food:**  
Just-in-time preparation means maximum freshness. Your tomatoes were picked that morning, your bread came out of the oven hours ago. This is farm-direct at its best.

---

### Step 6: Pick Up at the Market ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT STEP**

**What you do:**
1. Visit the market on your scheduled pickup day
2. Find the vendor's booth (location in your order details)
3. Open your order in the app → Tap **"I'm Here to Pick Up"**
4. Show your order number to the vendor
5. Vendor verifies and hands you your items
6. Check that you received everything

**Then—this is critical:**  
**Tap "Yes, I Received Everything" in your app**

**What happens next:**
- Vendor receives notification on their phone
- They tap "Yes, I Handed It Off" (within 30 seconds)
- Both screens turn green ✅
- This triggers payment to the vendor

**Why both parties confirm:**  
This is the digital handshake. It protects you (vendor can't claim they delivered if they didn't) and protects the vendor (you can't claim you didn't receive items if you did). Both confirmations happen face-to-face, standing at the booth together.

**IMPORTANT: Don't walk away until both of you see green screens.**

This 30-second confirmation ensures:
- You actually received your items
- Vendor actually handed them off
- Payment happens fairly and transparently
- No disputes about "who got what"

**Benefits to you:**
- Payment doesn't go to vendor until you confirm
- If items are missing/wrong, you can report the issue instead of confirming
- You're protected from vendor no-shows
- Clear accountability

**Benefits to vendors:**
- They get paid immediately after honest handoff
- No risk of customers falsely claiming non-delivery
- Clear proof of transaction completion

**Benefits to local food:**  
Trust is everything in direct-to-consumer relationships. This confirmation system builds mutual accountability, making farmers markets safer for everyone—buyers, vendors, and the platform that connects you.

---

### Step 7: Enjoy Your Fresh, Local Food

**What you do:** Take your items home and enjoy!

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Vendor receives payment (usually within 1-2 business days)
- You can rate your experience
- Order history saved for easy reordering

**Why this matters:**  
Every purchase directly supports a local producer. Your money goes to someone in your community who grows, bakes, or makes real food with their own hands.

**The ripple effect:**
- Local farmers can invest in next season's crops
- Artisans can expand their offerings
- Markets grow and thrive
- More neighbors discover fresh, local food
- Your community's food system gets stronger

**Benefits to you:**
- Freshest food possible (often harvested that day)
- Know where your food comes from
- Build relationships with producers
- Support your local economy

**Benefits to local food:**  
When you vote with your dollars, you're saying "I want more of this." Markets expand. New vendors join. Small farms stay viable. This is how we rebuild local food systems—one order at a time.

---

## Important Policies

### Cancellation Policy

**Within 1 hour of ordering:** Free cancellation, full refund  
**After 1 hour:** 25% cancellation fee applies

**Why the fee exists:**  
After one hour, vendors are preparing your order—harvesting, packing, labeling. The cancellation fee compensates them for this work and reserved inventory.

**Best practice:** Order with confidence, cancel quickly if plans change.

---

### What If Something Goes Wrong?

**Items missing or incorrect?**  
→ Don't tap "I Received Everything." Tap "Report Issue" instead and work it out with the vendor on the spot.

**Vendor not at the market?**  
→ Contact support immediately through the app. We'll investigate and issue a full refund if appropriate.

**Quality issue you didn't notice until later?**  
→ Contact the vendor directly (info in your order). Most are happy to make things right. If they don't respond, contact platform support.

---

## Tips for a Great Experience

✅ **Order by the cutoff time** (usually 18 hours before market for traditional markets, 10 hours for private pickups)  
✅ **Set a calendar reminder** for your pickup day  
✅ **Have your app open** when you arrive at the booth  
✅ **Bring reusable bags** (vendors may not provide them)  
✅ **Confirm the handoff** before you walk away  
✅ **Leave a rating** to help other shoppers and encourage great vendors  

---

# SECTION 2: FOR VENDORS

## Welcome to Farm-Direct Sales

**You're about to gain a powerful tool for selling at farmers markets.**

Stop guessing what to bring. Stop packing up unsold inventory at day's end. Stop worrying about cash handling and payment processing.

With our platform, customers order in advance, you prepare exactly what's needed, and you receive secure payment after confirmed delivery—all through your phone.

**This is how selling at farmers markets should work.**

---

## Your Selling Journey (8 Steps)

### Step 1: Create Your Listings

**What you do:** List the products you'll bring to the market.

**Include:**
- Photos (show your product at its best)
- Description (what makes it special?)
- Price (what you need to earn)
- Quantity available
- Pickup locations (which markets/days)

**How pricing works:**
- You set the base price you need
- Platform adds 6.5% + $0.15 buyer service fee (buyer pays this)
- Platform deducts 6.5% + $0.15 vendor service fee from your payout
- Example: You set $10 → Buyer pays $10.80 → You receive $9.20

**Why transparent pricing matters:**  
Buyers see exactly what they're paying. You see exactly what you're earning. No hidden fees, no surprises. This builds trust.

**Benefits to you:**
- Reach customers who shop from home
- Pre-orders mean less waste (bring only what's ordered)
- Digital payment means no cash handling
- Build your customer base beyond market day

**Benefits to local food:**  
When farmers can plan production around confirmed orders, food waste drops dramatically. This makes small-scale farming more economically viable.

---

### Step 2: Receive Orders

**What happens:**
- Customers browse your products and place orders
- You receive email notification for each order
- Orders show in your vendor dashboard

**Order cutoff times:**
- Traditional markets: 18 hours before market opens
- Private pickups: 10 hours before pickup time
- After cutoff, new orders stop for that market date

**Why cutoffs exist:**  
You need time to harvest, prepare, and pack orders. Cutoffs ensure you have reasonable notice and can plan your prep work.

**Benefits to you:**
- Know what to bring before you start packing
- Reduce guesswork and overproduction
- Focus energy on confirmed orders
- Less product sitting unsold at day's end

**Benefits to local food:**  
Pre-orders allow small producers to operate efficiently. Less waste means better margins. Better margins mean farming stays viable.

---

### Step 3: Confirm Orders (Within 24 Hours)

**What you do:** Review each order and confirm you can fulfill it.

**Consider:**
- Do you have enough inventory/ingredients?
- Can you harvest/prepare in time?
- Any unexpected issues (weather, supply problems)?

**If you CAN fulfill:** Tap "Confirm Order"  
**If you CAN'T fulfill:** Contact customer through platform to discuss alternatives or cancel

**Why this step is critical:**  
You're making a promise to a customer who's already paid. Confirming early gives them time to find alternatives if needed, and gives you clarity on what to prepare.

**Benefits to you:**
- Avoid disappointing customers with no-shows
- Time to communicate if there's a problem
- Build reputation for reliability
- Control your workload

**Benefits to customers:**  
They know their order is coming. No uncertainty. This trust makes them more likely to order again.

**Benefits to local food:**  
Honest communication is the foundation of direct-to-consumer relationships. Farmers who communicate well build loyal customers who become advocates.

---

### Step 4: Prepare Orders

**What you do:**
- Harvest, bake, or prepare items fresh
- Pack each order separately
- Label with order number (very important!)
- Bring to market on scheduled day

**Best practices:**
- Pack orders the morning of the market (maximum freshness)
- Double-check quantities against order details
- Use sturdy packaging (items need to survive the trip home)
- Keep orders organized for easy retrieval

**Benefits to you:**
- Bring exactly what's needed (no waste)
- Orders are labeled and organized
- Faster market setup (you know what you have)
- More time to focus on walk-up customers

**Benefits to customers:**  
They're getting food prepared specifically for them, harvested at peak ripeness, handled with care. This is the quality they're paying for.

**Benefits to local food:**  
Peak freshness and minimal waste are what make local food superior to industrial agriculture. You're showcasing why farm-direct matters.

---

### Step 5: Mark Items Ready for Pickup

**What you do:** Before market opens, mark orders as "Ready for Pickup" in your dashboard.

**This triggers:**
- Customer notification that their order is ready
- Order appears in your "Pickup Mode" screen
- Customer knows to come to your booth

**When to do this:**  
Morning of market day, once items are packed and you're confident they're ready.

**Benefits to you:**
- Customers know to expect you
- Reduces "did you bring my order?" questions
- Creates professional impression
- Sets clear expectations

**Benefits to customers:**  
They receive confirmation their items are waiting. This builds excitement and ensures they don't forget to come pick up.

---

### Step 6: Set Up Pickup Mode at Your Booth

**What you do:** Open your vendor dashboard → Tap "Pickup Mode"

**What you'll see:**
- List of all orders ready for pickup at this market
- Order numbers (large and prominent)
- Customer names
- Items in each order

**Use this like a checklist:**  
When customers arrive, scan your list for their order number, grab their items, hand them over.

**Benefits to you:**
- All pickup orders in one organized view
- No digging through emails or notes
- Quick verification of order details
- Professional customer service

**Benefits to customers:**  
Fast, efficient service. You look prepared and professional. This builds trust.

---

### Step 7: Confirm the Handoff ⭐ **MOST IMPORTANT STEP**

**What happens:**
1. Customer arrives at your booth
2. They show you their order number (on their phone)
3. You verify the number matches your list
4. You hand over all items in the order
5. Customer checks everything is correct
6. **Customer taps "Yes, I Received Everything" in their app**

**Then—this is critical:**  
**Your phone shows urgent notification: "Customer confirmed receipt. Confirm you handed it off?"**

**You have 30 seconds to tap "Yes, I Handed It Off"**

**What happens next:**
- Both screens turn green ✅
- Payment transfers to your account immediately
- Order marked complete

**Why both parties confirm:**  
This is the digital handshake. It protects you (customer can't claim they didn't receive items if they did) and protects the customer (you can't claim you delivered if you didn't). Both confirmations happen face-to-face, at the booth together.

**IMPORTANT: Don't let the customer walk away until both of you see green screens.**

This 30-second confirmation ensures:
- You actually handed off the items
- Customer actually received them
- Payment happens fairly and immediately
- No disputes about "who got what"

**What if you don't confirm within 30 seconds?**  
Your account gets temporarily restricted:
- ❌ Can't confirm other pickups
- ❌ Can't mark new items ready
- ❌ Can't create or edit listings

**You must resolve the pending confirmation before you can continue working.**

**Why this restriction exists:**  
Payment doesn't transfer until both parties confirm. If you're not confirming promptly, other customers waiting for their pickups can't get paid out either. The restriction ensures you prioritize completing transactions.

**Benefits to you:**
- Get paid immediately after honest handoff
- Protection from customers falsely claiming non-delivery
- Clear proof transaction was completed
- Build trust through transparency

**Benefits to customers:**  
They're protected. Payment doesn't go to you until they confirm. This accountability makes them comfortable ordering in advance.

**Benefits to local food:**  
Trust is hard to build in online transactions. This system creates accountability that makes farm-direct e-commerce safe and reliable. More trust = more sales for all vendors.

---

### Step 8: Receive Payment

**What happens:**
- Immediately after both confirmations, payment transfers from platform to your account
- Payout typically arrives in 1-2 business days
- You can track payouts in your vendor dashboard

**What you receive:**
- Base price minus platform fee (6.5% + $0.15)
- Example: Item priced at $10 → You receive $9.20

**Platform fee covers:**
- Payment processing (we pay Stripe's fees, not you)
- Order management system
- Customer notifications
- Pickup confirmation system
- Dispute resolution
- Marketing to bring customers to platform

**Benefits to you:**
- No cash handling
- No card readers to buy or maintain
- Automatic payment tracking
- Clear financial records for taxes
- Money in bank account, not cash box

**Benefits to local food:**  
Digital payments make small-scale farming more professional and sustainable. Clear records, reliable income, less risk of theft—this is how we help farmers thrive.

---

## Important Policies

### Order Confirmation Deadline

**Confirm or cancel orders within 24 hours.**

If you don't respond, customers can cancel and receive full refund. This protects them from uncertainty.

---

### Cancellation Handling

**If customer cancels within 1 hour:** Full refund to customer, no fee.

**If customer cancels after 1 hour:**  
- 25% cancellation fee charged
- You receive most of this fee (after platform fees)
- Compensates you for prep time and reserved inventory

**If you need to cancel an order:**  
Contact customer through platform immediately. Offer alternatives if possible. Full refund issued to customer.

---

### Quality Expectations

**Customers expect:**
- Fresh, high-quality products
- Accurate weights and quantities
- Items that match descriptions and photos
- Professional packaging

**If a customer reports an issue:**  
Work it out directly with them if possible. Platform support can mediate if needed.

**Building reputation:**  
Your ratings and reviews determine how often you appear in search. Consistently great products and service = more visibility = more sales.

---

## Tips for Success

✅ **Confirm orders promptly** (within a few hours is ideal)  
✅ **Mark items ready** on market morning (keeps customers informed)  
✅ **Keep your phone charged** (you need it for confirmations)  
✅ **Label orders clearly** (prevents mix-ups)  
✅ **Confirm handoffs immediately** (don't make customers wait)  
✅ **Communicate proactively** (if there's an issue, say so early)  
✅ **Update listings regularly** (keep prices and descriptions current)  

---

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

**Customer doesn't show up to pick up their order?**  
→ After 24 hours, you can mark it as no-show. Platform will investigate and compensate you if appropriate.

**Customer says items are missing/wrong at pickup?**  
→ Verify together at the booth. Make it right if possible. If dispute continues, platform support will review.

**Technical issues during confirmation?**  
→ Contact support immediately. Don't leave the market until confirmation is resolved.

---

# SECTION 3: HOW IT WORKS TOGETHER

## The Complete Journey: From Browse to Bite

**This is how farm-direct commerce should work—simple, transparent, and fair to everyone.**

---

## The Ecosystem View

### 🌱 The Foundation: Local Food Production

**Farmers and artisans** grow, raise, bake, and make real food.

Small-scale production means:
- Seasonal, diverse crops (not monoculture)
- Attention to quality over quantity
- Environmentally conscious practices
- Food that's fresh, not shipped thousands of miles

**But they face challenges:**
- Guessing what to bring to market
- Unpredictable sales (weather, competition, foot traffic)
- Wasted inventory when things don't sell
- Cash handling and payment processing hassles

---

### 🏪 The Market: Where Connection Happens

**Farmers markets** bring producers and customers face-to-face.

Markets offer:
- Community gathering space
- Direct relationships between farmers and eaters
- Variety and discovery
- Supporting local economy

**But they have limitations:**

3. **Vendor verifies** order number
4. **Hands over items** from pre-packed order
5. **Buyer confirms** received in app

7. **Both see green** ✅ = transaction complete

**Why this moment is sacred:**
- It's the physical exchange (digital meets tangible)
- Both parties accountable (mutual confirmation)

- Community is strengthened (this is what markets are about)

**This 30-second confirmation ritual:**
