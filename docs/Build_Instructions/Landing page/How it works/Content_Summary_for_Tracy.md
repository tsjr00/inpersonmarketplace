## 🎯 KEY THEMES THROUGHOUT

### 1. The Handoff is Sacred
Every section emphasizes the face-to-face confirmation moment:
- Both parties present
- 30-second window
- Digital handshake
- Trust building ritual

### 2. Benefits on Three Levels

**Individual:**
- Buyers: freshness, convenience, protection
- Vendors: predictability, payment, efficiency

**System:**
- Less waste
- Better economics
- Stronger markets

**Movement:**
- Local food systems
- Environmental impact
- Community resilience

### 3. Transparency Builds Trust
Repeatedly explains:
- Exact pricing breakdown
- Where money goes
- Why fees exist
- How payment flows
- What protects each party

### 4. Structure with Positivity
Firm expectations:
- "You must confirm within 30 seconds"
- "Don't walk away until green screen"
- "$10 minimum order"

But framed positively:
- "This protects you"
- "This makes it fair"
- "This supports the system"
