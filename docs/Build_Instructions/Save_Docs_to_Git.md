- `/docs/Session_Summaries/`

---

## CC ACTION: Add README Files

**File: /docs/Build_Instructions/README.md**
```markdown
# Build Instructions

Naming convention: Phase-[ID]-[Feature-Name].md

Examples:
- Phase-K-1-Markets-Foundation.md
- Phase-K-2-Vendor-Analytics.md
- Phase-K-3-Flash-Sales.md

All Build Instructions stored flat in this folder for easy access.
```

**File: /docs/Session_Summaries/README.md**
```markdown
# Session Summaries

Naming convention: Phase-[ID]-[Feature-Name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md

Examples:
- Phase-K-1-Markets-Foundation-2026-01-13.md
- Phase-K-1-Markets-Foundation-2026-01-14.md (if multiple sessions)
- Phase-K-2-Vendor-Analytics-2026-01-13.md

All session summaries stored flat in this folder. 
Multiple sessions per phase append date or session number.
```

3. Committed and pushed
4. Structure ready for parallel sessions

---

## CC ACTION: Initial Commit

**CC: Commit message:**

docs: Create build session folders for Markets and Analytics phases
```

**CC: Push to GitHub**

---

---

## For Tracy: After CC Completes This

**CC will create:**
- Phase folders in Git
- Placeholder READMEs

**Tracy's next action:**
1. Download these files from viewer pane (click each, save):
   - Build_Instructions_Markets_Foundation.md
   - Build_Instructions_Vendor_Analytics.md
2. Keep in local folder: `C:\GitHub\Projects\FastWrks-Docs\`
3. Reference them when giving to CC-1 and CC-2

**Why not save to Git now?**
- Full files are 10,000+ tokens
- You'll give them directly to CC when launching sessions
- Git has the folder structure ready
- More efficient workflow

**After this task:** Foundation complete, ready for parallel sessions
