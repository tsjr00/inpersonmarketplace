more 1/23/26 testing – feedback – changes



• In looking at the markets listing page the use my zip code or use my location box is still the same height on the markets page it is smaller on the vendors page which is good but we need it consistent so use the smaller version on the markets page as well and looking at the the listing cards the market cards below the search area yeah you moved the calendar information lower on the card and the description up which is good and we got rid of the farmers market and that's good um but we still don't show the address information on these cards when we are supposed to - so for example the market titled international market of the High Plains that's the name then there's a description under it and if you open that market profile there is an address and some times and dates listed but for some reason we are not pulling that information over into the card however the card next to it which is for the market titled SW bougie market it does have the times next to it it does not have the dates but it should and so something is happening where there's an inconsistency in the data that's being populated into these cards and so an important thing to keep in mind is that from time to time the admin may adjust some information on the card um because we don't have market managers logging in the admin who's going to be making adjustments if they find out that the market hours have changed where the market season has changed or even if the market moved to a new location the admin will be able to change that at least they should be able to but the system needs to periodically read that and and push it back out to the cards on this markets listing page so that they're accurate whatever our current process is is not working consistently because I entered both of these markets myself manually and I put the information in there and they're being treated differently so research that and find out what triggers what type of treatment or even if you don't need to do that that's fine but what we do need is a consistent process where it writes what's on the market profile into the card in the appropriate format like we have here O while I'm looking at these cards um the little calendar block in the shaded green area that's it's fine I I like having it but I think we have a little bit more padding around the text on that green shaded block we could reduce the padding above and below the text and get another line of text in there so we could show the market name the description the address the dates of market operation not each Saturday but or not each Sunday but the day of the week that they're open and the hours of operation um so you may have to get a little creative with the formatting to get all that information in there but we want to like the idea of showing when the next market is but if we need to drop that in order to get the items that I said on there then then that's OK because if it's if it's if it's every Sunday from this start date to that end date then the user can figure out that ohh that's three days from now and so the little calendar icon um ohh I see the calendar icon is actually when the mark when the order cutoff is OK so that is valuable information but it doesn't mention anything about the product or about an order cutoff and so having that information on there like for this example it says Sunday January 25th at 2:30 AM well that the user has no perspective for what that information is it would make it look like there's something happening at that market at 2:30 in the morning when the market is actually only open from 2:30 to 6:30 in that market should actually be only open in the afternoon so I'll double check that but anyway I'm not sure what that information is now that little calendar thing it might be helpful or it might be redundant but the information we want on there is the title the description the address the dates of the market and the time like the opening and closing date of the market and then the weekly time that is more important than the the calendar the the users can figure out when the next market is now it is possible we may need to lengthen the card or we may need to widen the card and then have fewer cards across in a row um work with the formatting on that a quick word about the address because the farmers markets are not a private location it is OK for us to show the address all the time even when a user is not logged in however for private pickup locations there is a rule that a user must be logged in etc the actual address of where private pickup location is they can see the name of the private pickup location or they can just see that there is a private pickup location and that's probably actually a better practice but I just don't want there to be any confusion about where the requirement is for showing or not showing based upon logged in or not logged in.

• OK this is just a a reinforcement note it may not be any action to take on this I'm looking at the vendors listing page they're local vendors page and I'm seeing information that was inserted and so this may not be relevant for real life but double checking so we have standard test form 1 standard test form 2 those cards are very short in comparison to the cards above them it says 0 listings and so um if this is just because it's inserted data and some of the rules were circumvented then that's OK for now but we have to have it right for when we're having live data in there first thing if there are no listings then the we need to think about this give me your thoughts on this if we if if a vendor does not have any listings on the platform should their card be visible in the search on this local vendors page it would seem to me it should not because the idea being a shopper is on this page looking for a vendor so they can buy something if they have nothing for sale then they shouldn't be on the page now their vendor profile will still be active and if a vendor has a link to their vendor profile somewhere out there then you know we want people to be able to find them on the platform because maybe they're in between seasons maybe they don't have anything for sale because they haven't done harvest um so we don't want that to be deactivated or not visible but we want this set of cards here to be for people who are looking to buy things on the platform and so if there are no active listings then there should not be a card shown.  


• In the folder C:\GitHub\Projects\inpersonmarketplace\Farmers Marketing App Logo there are the platforms new logos.  The ‘full logo – color.png’ is the main logo but if we have places where subtle branding can be used as a reinforcing asset then you can use the ‘logo no words – color.png’  image.,  deploy these logos now and I I need to upload them to supabase let me know & provide instructions.
