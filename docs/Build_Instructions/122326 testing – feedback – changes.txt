1/23/26 testing – feedback – changes

 i'm testing orders and i am logged in As a buyer who has some inserted orders I am looking at order number FW-2026-00007 the order is marked complete it says picked up and so this should have no changes able to be done on this order yet the cancel item button is still um you can still click on the cancel order cancel item button and then it goes to process asking you to give a reason why and then confirm and it says that you will get a reason a refund so we need to apply some status checks so that the cancellation option is no longer there for picked up Orient completed orders I'm not sure which of those status is is used but whatever status says that the order is completed then the cancellation option should not be available.  I also see that on that order the items are still listed as pending payment and so please check into what that means is that a a status where the order has been completed but payment has not yet been provided to the vendor if so I I don't know if we actually want that to be visible or changeable except particularly in the scenario of where somebody doesn't get what they ordered they're supposed to check that when they pick it up and not confirm that they have received it so this completed status assumes that they have completed and they have verified that they've got what they asked for so I don't think we want to be involved in I don't mean we want the platform involved in anything happening after the user or the shopper has confirmed that they have received what they ordered at least we don't want to facilitate and make it easy um that should be with with the vendor directly because we did our part as a platform if they need to buy the feedback mechanism or something like that but I don't think we wanna open the door for somebody canceling an item after they've confirmed it because then people will game the system So just to finish U on that thought when an item is showing in the list uh when an order is showing on the mayors page this is URL farmers market slash buyer slash orders if there if there's there shouldn't be a scenario where there's pending payment and the order is completed unless that's something that's flowing back to stripe and we're seeing that input from stripe letting the person know that this has not come out of your account yet I guess that's OK and good to have that information but we don't want to offer the option to cancel it but my guess is this is just something that was inserted testing purposes
Let's go ahead and remove the share your feedback card from the buyers course page is prominent on the dashboard for for shoppers buyers that should be enough Also in order to save screen real estate and looking at the the my orders listing here once we have an order that is completed we can can we can remove the visibility of the individual items that was included in that order in the area beneath it so once again for the same order ending in 00007 it has three items listed beneath it but if that order is completed then that means the customer already has it so we don't need to show each of those items and take up all that room on the screen we can actually just show the the top kind of bar that has the big order number in the green box and to that end because it's clickable anyway it's gonna open all the different items that were in there so we only need to show that one bar um and because we're already pulling those item names in the logic instead of writing them into three separate locations we can just list them in small print on that one bar card that contains the order number the status the date and the price and so if an order is completed let's consolidate all that into one row and save the screen real estate but if an order is is in pending or received or something like that actually you know I think until him I was going to say until an order is ready for pickup maybe we OK so tell me your thoughts on the idea of just consolidating the orders like noting multiple orders but all the information just rolling it up into one one row where we have the order number prominent and then we make the status easier to see so that was just one row they can see the status like OK this has been confirmed this is this has been processed or whatever the status is and then lastly this is ready for pick up and then on the ones that are ready for pick up we would highlight that on the orders list like we already have it highlighted on the UM on the vendor dashboard the user dashboard because this could become a lengthy list of orders and we don't want to have them scrolling and we don't want to necessarily have to put everything on the screen that's just more information that's being sent back and forth that they're not actually consuming so if they have to tap on it anyway let's go ahead and reduce that data being transmitted until they tap on that screen but we put all the data on run row and if it's ready for pickup then they're going to see it on their shopper dashboard anyway so most of the time this is my borders area is gonna be opened up to look at the status of orders that have not been picked up yet to see hey you know what happened with that I'm going to the market or let me just make sure that got received that kind of thing um so yeah maybe that's aids fractions of pennies and API calls or you know stuff being sent back and forth the problem with that let me know but I think that's probably saving time and energy


• And it looks like on the user dashboard for we still have in the footer a simple text handling saying it didn't sell income event with an arrow because we changed the vendor the vendor section the user dashboard people who are not ours to to make that more visible we can remove that link from the bottom um I think we can take it out of the the footer of all of the dashboards because either they're already a vendor or we've got it covered just above it and 
• I'm looking at this this card under the vendor section Where we have a placeholder for the vendor dashboard-   if we're going to have this space here and we're already going to be putting text into it and put some additional stuff in there to make it more encouraging to become a vendor you know something like make extra money on your make extra money from your chin you know put your baking make turn your baking skills into profit or something like that where we give a like a few little examples that would encourage and it's easy um highlight the easiness of becoming a vendor and starting to sell instead of just saying like when you're ready to start selling like what the language you have is good and that's kind of the call to action but let's we can put some other incentivizing type language in there and a few bullet points –  do what makes sense

I'm thinking about the shoppers need 2 communicate with the vendor and how much of A need that is and if we want to facilitate that like we just added the share feedback a button um and so now we have a place for shoppers to send a message categorized and we also have a way for the admin to receive it how much value is it compared to the technical person and ongoing database etcetera or getting the users I mean giving the person the OD you send a message to the vendor but we want to put parameters around that it's not supposed to be like it's not messaging platform we don't want freeform back and forth kind of stuff I don't think you tell me what you think the views on that and the token considerations around it but I'm thinking OK let's say that what tell me what you think about scenarios would exist there a shopper needs to and with a vendor like I can see scenarios around hey I want to cancel my order or I want two of those three of those we don't want that to happen so it's about implementing that type of communication method because then the showers I mean the vendors are there is location where their customer has them hey I won't do something different than what I agree to and that has operational and actually impact because most of the time they're going to be calling to change in order not calling they're going to be messaging change in order in order not going to be calling to put more stuff on there so that that's what hesitant about that medication but it does allow for the relationship between the buyer and seller and that has value is has value to the the certainly but how does it have to our platform we have the value for the way the things and the way that you so tell me the goods and bads of instituting that type of communication instead of just sharing feedback with the platform admin sharing feedback with the vendor you know and so maybe that's an opportunity work like a a rating system as well would good so like I know this is crossing over different subject so maybe you're in order completed and um picked up on the dashboard below 3 cards we have right now that saved the product order and back is a uh uh I I got a card that's pretty visible same with card that says rate or last order or some of those lines and it would be an opportunity for them to give the vendor feedback on a 5 star one to five and it would show them on that little basically the same information is being shown on the the my orders it doesn't even be they've already completed order it can say you know like this transaction go and it can show who the was that the item was and then on the right hand side like one to five stars and then click on or they can put another you know they can leave the field whatever is easiest technically but I think what that does is people like ratings wanna do business with vendors that have the ratings and that's A and a pretty feature of selling platforms being able to identify high quality Anders becomes something where our vendors want to better us they're being evaluated so tell me about how we could do that and around what any technical burden that comes along with that as well - And then the star rating if we choose to go along with this that cumulative star rating would show up on the vendors profile page in that top card which would may mean that we need to change the the premium icon because right now we use premium with a star next to it but if we're going to include a star system you can change that or we could do like a number of baskets instead of number of stars it's it's you know he's got 5 baskets what stars is pretty much easily accepted and easily recognized we should probably use the system for ratings that do ratings and then we change what the premium icon is to something else that also communicates extra value or something special

• OK here's another little thing with the orders um I'm back on the orders screen still logged in as a buyer there are two orders showing the top one is order number FW-2026-6448 next to the green box with order number it says pending payment and then across from it it shows $40.68 as the total amount due beneath that it says local honey quantity 336 dollars and so I think what's happening here is that in this local honey in this item description line it is showing the amount of the calculation for the actual product and then in the order line it is showing the amount with our platform fee I'm not sure I haven't checked into that yet if that is the case then then we can't have that everywhere that the buyer sees a price it always has to have the buyers portion of the platform fee built into it consistently the only time that a price is visible without the platform fee being included is when the vendor is entering that product into the system and then the vendor itself himself herself is looking at their products so when they're looking at their things or their market boxes they see their price without our platform fee included but when a buyer sees a price the buyer always sees the vendor price plus their portion of the platform fee included in the deal price OK but that was a side note sorry about that what I was originally noticing in addition to the price was that on the I called the order summary line as opposed to the order detail line the order detail line is where the individual products are listed the order summary line is where the order number is the total amount all that stuff but no product information but in the future we will have what information in there once we validate that into one line for at least completed orders maybe for all orders except for any pickup so anyway back to what was saying it says pending payment next to the order number it also says pending payment over by the price but when I enter they used the status filter and I change it from all orders to pending pending as an order status nothing involved payment but pending then the order that is saying pending payment remains visible so I think we may have used the little pill saying pending payment for both financial amount or a financial reality or status also an order status and so those are not the same thing if we're receiving information from stripe that says pending payment or something like that that's valid we can go ahead and retain that little pill so so a shopper knows that they have not technically been charged for that yet but I'm still not sure that's necessary but more information is good but when it comes to order status we don't want to conflate pending and pending orders this which is what it looks like is happening now that might be a logic issue but most likely it's just a verbiage issue and it was more efficient to reuse the pending payment bill instead of creating another one order pending but when we talk about the status of an item let's be specific and saying order pending instead of payment pending or on a different status order completed that type of thing so we remove any question shouldn't be question because it's right next to the order number but nonetheless let's make it easier for people who don't pay attention to along with the process guiding them through



• OK further clarification O on the my orders page which is URL farmers_market slash buyer slash orders there's a status dropdown that has more statuses than I think we're actually capturing so it looks like you may have estimated some status without referencing the actual statuses that we're using we've got statuses of like paid completed canceled order to confirm all different stuff that's in that list but that's not correlating to the different statuses that the vendor sees and the vendor is going to be the one that drives the status change unless the buyer cancels an order before a certain point - The status is that the vendor is using to drive the progress of the order forward the vendor sees pending confirmed ready for pick up fulfilled and cancelled so I'm not sure why the vendor would see a status of pending I think they would see a status of order placed and all orders would come in from the buyer to the vendor with the status of order placed now as I say this I recognize there may be multiple parts of the app that rely upon this status and so we don't actually have to change it the vendor is smart enough to figure out that an order that's pending is before it's confirmed and so it comes in as pending let's not go changing things unnecessarily I don't want to introduce more potential bugs into the system but from this list of statuses the vendor's first action is to we acknowledge and order ohh no it's gonna be to confirm in order and so confirming an order means that they have received it like they have the order and they're confirming I have this order and in my mind that means that once the order has been confirmed and the vendor has said yes I am committing to fulfilling this order because we are a pre sales platform that's the nature of what we do that order should not be eligible for the buyer to cancel without a penalty and that penalty is either auto enforced or optionally enforced so that's another element to the ordering flow that we need to include because if people are going to commit to a presale and get the benefit of it then their commitment has to mean something and the the way that means something is that once an order is confirmed and the vendor has made their commitment to the process then the buyer no longer gets to cancel without penalty now the vendor can choose to not enforce that penalty as a customer service mechanism but as a platform we are going to unless the buyer says otherwise and then I think we talked through this previously and that was a a healthy percentage of the order something close to 50% to discourage cancellations and then the the vendor gets to decide something we need to figure out what the vendor gets to decide not make it too complex but also give them the authority to not charge that to their client but we need to balance that with the reality that that's a transaction that we as a platform provided the technical facilitation for but did not get paid for so we should get something out of it we should get a minimum percentage of the order applied as a cancellation slash restocking fee something like that and then if the buyer wants to remove the remainder of that fee they can or you tell me some other combination of you know what you're thinking about this  - but that's also a sidetrack away from the status flow so an order comes in from the buyer as pending when it's received by the vendor it becomes confirmed and then the system should change the order status from the buyers perspective to confirmed but it doesn't need to do that all the time it only needs to do that whenever they open that card so we're not unnecessarily sending data back and forth and eating up cycles and API calls um so I guess it would change the status on the on the vendor side and then upon whatever save activity it changes the status and then when the buyer opens the card then it calls that over but the status flow would be from pending to confirmed to ready for pickup and then to fulfilled and so we want the buyers status view to reflect that same process and cancellation is an outlier but it's still on the bottom of the list but included in that cancellation flow when it says why do you want to cancel um I'm not even sure we need to know why they want to cancel yeah OK so we will include the message of why they want to cancel in the notification to the seller the vendor that this item was cancelled and here's the reason that the buyer said and then we inform the like in the in the blurb that that we're telling the buyer when they're saying they want to cancel it we need to tell them that there is a cancellation fee of X percent will be applied let's think on that too we don't want to look like a were mean but we still need to get paid for the use of our platform OI guess we can calculate the amount and say a cancellation fee of this much will be applied to the order but we also need to let them know that there is a potential cancellation fee from the vendor but let's see all this is happening this is happening before the vendor has decided to help me think through that what's the logical flow here to keep the customer informed without making them unnecessarily angry and then we allow for the vendor to decide what cancellation they're going to apply a cancellation fee or slash restocking fee is how we should phrase it what that should be applied after the vendor makes that decision and informs the system so there's a we want to tell them upfront something's happening but we may not be able to give them an actual number at that time so maybe we just use up two language there'll be a cancellation fee of up to 50% applied to this order I think that's probably clean and then if we say up to 50% but they only get hit with the 5% cancellation fee they're much happier let's go that way so the platform will always get something even on the cancellation and then the vendor will have the opportunity to get more because they're the ones who has actually lost out on the the sale that they were anticipated on OK so make sure that gets all worked into the system and tell me how that's going to get done

•  OK so continuing with the status differential the differences between buyer status and vendor status on orders on the buyer side they see all orders pending paid confirmed ready for pickup completed cancelled so um we're going to change what the buyers see the paid doesn't seem to fit in the order flow and so I think we take that out of this order status and if we need to have a separate status for paid not paid um which makes sense because they could potentially place an order as a buyer and then the vendor could be paying attention see the order come up immediately know that they have the inventory and confirm it but If the buyer doesn't have the money then the Seller's not going to get paid so tell me about what information we get from stripe what statuses how quickly that happens are there opportunities is there a gap where there could be an order that is placed through the cart where there is not sufficient funds to make sure the order gets paid and so I'm trying to see if we really need a paid not paid status on our side or if that's going to be fully handled by stripe if it's fully handled by stripe that's much much better and we should organize things so it is so if they don't have the money the transaction isn't completed and there is no real problem for the vendor but in your recommendations and in your architecture planning consider where we show or don't show the paid not paid status but it won't be in the order status list unless it really needs to be but I don't think it needs to be.
