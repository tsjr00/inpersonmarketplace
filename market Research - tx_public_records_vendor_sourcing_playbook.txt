TEXAS: Public-Info Sourcing for Farmers-Market / Pickup Preorder Vendors
(Playbook + copy/paste request language)
Last updated: 2026-01-17

IMPORTANT CORRECTION (Cottage Food vs. Permits)
- In Texas, local public health entities generally MAY NOT require a cottage food production operation (CFPO) to obtain a local license/permit or pay a fee to produce/sell cottage foods directly to consumers. (SB 541 changes take effect 9/1/2025 and add DSHS registration paths for certain cottage activities.)
- Therefore: do NOT expect “county health permits” to be a reliable way to list ordinary cottage food producers.
- Instead:
  (1) Market organizer/vendor rosters (city/county-run or city/county-permitted markets)
  (2) Temporary food permits (for non-exempt foods, prepared foods, TCS foods, etc.)
  (3) DSHS cottage food registrations (statewide list for certain cottage categories beginning 9/1/2025)

============================================================
PRIORITY SOURCE 1 (Texas): MARKET ORGANIZER / MARKET ROSTERS
============================================================

What this finds
- Vendors already selling in person on recurring schedules
- Market owners/organizers (your best “platform partner” targets)
- Vendor categories (produce, eggs, baked goods, crafts, etc.)

Why it’s valuable
- Directly matches your “order online → pickup at market/event” workflow
- Provides BOTH sides of your acquisition problem:
  - Vendors to onboard
  - Organizers to partner with (bulk vendor acquisition)

What to request (records that usually exist)
- Vendor roster lists by season/date
- Vendor applications
- Booth/stall assignments (optional)
- Market rules/handbooks (good for compliance UX)
- Market permit or sponsorship agreements with the city/county (if applicable)

Where these records live (Texas reality check)
- If the market is run by a PUBLIC entity (city/county), records are usually with:
  - Parks & Recreation
  - Downtown/Main Street program
  - City Manager / City Secretary
  - County/community services department
- If the market is run by a private nonprofit/business:
  - The city may ONLY have the “special event permit” file (organizer, dates, insurance, etc.)
  - The vendor list may NOT be a public record unless submitted to a public entity

County-by-county “is this likely public?”
- HIGH likelihood: counties with major cities that run markets directly (common in metro counties)
- MEDIUM likelihood: counties where city issues recurring “market permits” and requires vendor rosters
- LOW likelihood: privately-run markets with minimal city involvement

Action steps (fastest way)
1) Use the Texas Dept. of Agriculture “Certified Farmers Markets” tool to identify markets in your target area.
2) For each market, determine: public-run vs private-run.
3) If public-run: send the Public Information Act request to the city/county.
4) If private-run: request the organizer’s contact info from the city (via permit file), then approach organizer directly.

1) Vendor rosters or vendor lists (including vendor name, business name, contact email, phone, mailing address if available, and product category/type);
2) Vendor applications and/or agreements submitted to [CITY/COUNTY] (redactions acceptable for sensitive personal information, but please retain business contact information where permissible);
3) Market operating rules/handbooks and any standard vendor requirements provided to vendors.

If available, please provide in a machine-readable format (CSV or Excel). If any portion is exempt, please produce the non-exempt portions and cite the specific exemption relied upon.
Thank you,

============================================================
PRIORITY SOURCE 2 (Texas): TEMPORARY FOOD ESTABLISHMENT (TFE) / EVENT FOOD PERMITS
============================================================

What this finds
- Vendors selling prepared foods, TCS foods, or foods not covered by cottage/produce exemptions
- High-relevance operators (already compliant; often higher volume)

Why it’s valuable
- These vendors have operational maturity and repeat-event behavior
- Permit records frequently include: name, business name, address, phone/email, event name/date

Where these records live (who issues the permit)
- If the event occurs in an area inspected/permitted by a CITY, COUNTY, or PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICT:
  -> you must request from that local authority.
- Otherwise, DSHS Public Health Region may handle permitting.

How to determine the correct authority for ANY county (the practical method)
A) Go to Texas DSHS “Local Health Departments” pages by Public Health Region and find your county.
B) If your county has a listed local health department/public health district:
   -> request permits/records from that local entity.
C) If your county is not covered by a local entity:
   -> request from the DSHS Public Health Region office responsible for the county.

Action steps
1) Pick your target counties.
2) Look up each county’s local health jurisdiction via DSHS Public Health Region LHD directory pages.
3) Send the TFE permit request to the correct authority.
4) Ask specifically for event name/date fields so you can map markets/fairs and recurring vendors.

============================================================
PRIORITY SOURCE 3 (Texas): DSHS COTTAGE FOOD REGISTRATIONS (Statewide; starts 9/1/2025)
============================================================

What this finds
Beginning 9/1/2025, DSHS indicates registration is required for certain cottage categories, including:
- CFPOs selling TCS foods (foods requiring time/temperature control for safety)
- Cottage food vendors who buy from CFPOs and sell directly to consumers
- Optional: registration to use a registration number instead of publishing a home address on the label (depending on the DSHS pathway used)

Why it’s valuable
- This is the closest thing to a statewide “cottage-adjacent” list
- Cottage food vendors (resellers/aggregators) are prime partnership targets

Where these records live
- Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) – Retail Food Establishments program (Open Records channel)

Action steps
1) Request the registry data by date range:
   - 9/1/2025 to present (or current active registrations)
2) Ask for registration type field(s) so you can segment:
   - CFPO-TCS
   - Cottage food vendor (reseller/aggregator)
   - Label-address substitute registration (if tracked as such)

Copy/paste request language (DSHS Cottage Food Registry)
SUBJECT: Texas Public Information Act Request – DSHS Cottage Food Registry Data (9/1/2025–Present)

Hello,
Under the Texas Public Information Act (Texas Government Code, Chapter 552), I request records from the Texas DSHS Retail Food Establishments program for the Texas DSHS Cottage Food Registry from September 1, 2025 to present (or current active registrations), including:

- Registrant name
- Business name (if collected)
- City and county
- Mailing address (if collected)
- Email and phone (if collected)
- Registration type/category (e.g., CFPO selling TCS foods; cottage food vendor/reseller; other registry purpose)
- Registration number
- Registration start date and end/expiration date (if applicable)

Please provide in CSV/Excel if available. If portions are exempt, please provide non-exempt portions and cite the applicable exemption(s).

COUNTY-BY-COUNTY “WHO’S DOING WHAT” (what I can and can’t guarantee from public web pages)
============================================================

What I CAN say with confidence (statewide rules)
1) Temporary food/event food permitting exists statewide, but the issuer varies:
   - Many counties are covered by a local health department or public health district.
   - Remaining counties are covered primarily by a DSHS Public Health Region office.
2) Cottage food registrations are maintained by DSHS statewide beginning 9/1/2025.
3) Market/vendor rosters are only guaranteed as public records when a public entity operates or requires them as part of permitting.

What I CANNOT fully verify “county-by-county” from only public websites in a reliable, automated way
- A complete 254-county, fully validated listing of:
  - which counties require vendor rosters for markets,
  - which counties require organizer-submitted vendor lists,
  - and which counties publish temporary vendor/market records online,
because many counties/cities do not publish those operational details consistently, and “farmer’s market” governance often sits at the CITY level, not county.

Best-practice workaround (still fast and precise)
- Use the DSHS Public Health Region “Local Health Departments” directory pages to map each county to the correct permitting authority for TFE/event food permits.
- Then focus your “market roster” requests on:
  (a) cities/counties operating markets (public-run), and
  (b) cities/counties issuing recurring special-event permits for markets/fairs.

Quick examples (from DSHS region directory pages; not exhaustive)
- Potter + Randall counties → Amarillo Public Health (local authority listing).
- Lubbock county → City of Lubbock Health Department (local authority listing).
- Harris county → Harris County Public Health; also City of Houston Health Department appears in the directory for Houston city jurisdiction.
(Use the DSHS directory pages to look up any other county.)

============================================================
NEXT STEP CHECKLIST (if you want to build your lead list efficiently)
============================================================

1) Pick 10–20 target counties (start where you can sell/operate).
2) For each county:
   A) Determine local health authority from DSHS directory page.
   B) Send the TFE permit request to that authority.
3) Identify top farmers markets in those counties:
   - TDA Certified Farmers Markets tool
   - USDA Farmers Market Directory
4) For each market:
   A) If public-run: send market roster request to city/county
   B) If private-run: pull the organizer info from permit file (city), then approach organizer
5) Separately: send DSHS Cottage Food Registry request (statewide) and filter by county.
