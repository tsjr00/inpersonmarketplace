-- Migration 162: get_available_pickup_dates — exclude manager-cancelled dates
--                (Session 92 cont. — Growth Phase C)
-- ============================================================================
-- Body is migration 131 VERBATIM + ONE NOT EXISTS filter in the matched_dates
-- CTE that drops any candidate date with a market_date_overrides row
-- (status='cancelled') for that market. Return shape is unchanged from mig 131,
-- so this is a plain CREATE OR REPLACE (NO DROP — is_listing_accepting_orders,
-- get_listings_accepting_status, validate_cart_item_schedule, and
-- cleanup_cart_items_invalid_schedules all call this function; a DROP would risk
-- them).
--
-- Propagation: every consumer wraps this function, so the cancelled date
-- vanishes from display (listing detail, browse, vendor listings) AND is
-- rejected at cart-validate + checkout (validate_cart_item_schedule wraps it).
--
-- Grants: this function is intentionally anon-executable (public buyer browse;
-- it is in migration 149's "LEFT exposed" allowlist). CREATE OR REPLACE keeps
-- existing grants — NO re-revoke needed.
--
-- ROLLBACK: re-apply migration 131's body (this file minus the NOT EXISTS block
-- marked "PHASE C").
